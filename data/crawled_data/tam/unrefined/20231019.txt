SKILLS AND DRILLS Double-Unders: Week 4 Day


Single-Double-Single-Double

Now we’re going to work on decreasing the number of single-unders between

double-under reps. Your goal in this phase is to find the rhythm of ‘single-double,

single-double, single-double…’

Goal Workout:

Complete 20 single-double reps, unbroken

Once you can complete this workout, move on to phase 5.

Note: MANY people get stuck here. It’s easy to think that this is “good enough”

because you can finish some double-under workouts with this method. Please do not

stay here! The goal is to be able to do unbroken double unders, so you need to make

sure you continue with the double under progression all the way to the end!
