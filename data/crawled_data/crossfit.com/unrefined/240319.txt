Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout contains 10 sprints. Athletes performing the workout as prescribed should have at least 20 seconds to accumulate as many wall-ball shots as possible in each round. Wall walks should be quick with minimal rest between reps. The load of the deadlifts, while moderately heavy, should allow athletes to go unbroken in each round. Scale the range of motion of the wall walks and the load of the deadlifts to hit this stimulus.


Intermediate option:

For 10 rounds, complete as many reps as possible in 1 minute of:


2 wall walks

4 deadlifts

Max wall-ball shots

*Rest 1 minute between rounds.


‚ôÄ
155-lb
 deadlift, 
10-lb
 ball to a 9-foot target

‚ôÇ
225-lb
 deadlift, 
14-lb
 ball to a 10-foot target


Beginner option:

For 10 rounds, complete as many reps as possible in 1 minute of:


2 
inchworms + push-up
 
4 deadlifts

Max wall-ball shots

*Rest 1 minute between rounds.


‚ôÄ
65-lb
 deadlift, 
6-lb
 ball to a 9-foot target

‚ôÇ

DeadLift 225lbs 2
Inchworm 2

Similar to 231227
Did this one as just a slow lift. Left out squatting to avoid HIIT stimulus. Think the 225lb deadlift was quite heavy + high volume. Probs should've scaled down to 185lbs. Couldn't do wallwalks at the powergym. 
Just checked the box as getting some heavy + high volume deadlifting.

As rx‚Äôd, 122 total wallballs.¬†
Each round being only a minute meant I could go pretty much all-out.¬† Deadlifts got a little tougher in later rounds.¬† Also, in later rounds I spent most of the 1 minute rest bent over and gasping.

Intermediate+ (4 of 10 were w/ 20# MedBall)
12/13/12/12/12/11/12/12/12/13 = 121 WBS
WW were too slow and DL station was a little further away than I would have liked - still a good pump.  Midline is feeling a little tender from Michael yesterday, so that slowed down the DLs a little.

Rxd at the Y. My stations were a little far apart, probably spent 10-12 seconds walking to each total each round. Only got 6-8 wall balls and time expired before I felt gassed each minute. 
132 reps total. 
lower back feels nice and spicy now.

4 deadlift, 225#
wall balls with 20# ball
0-6-6-6-6-4-5-6-6-6 = 51 wall balls
Went a little heavy for me, but wanted to emphasize strength vice speed today. 
61/5‚Äô8‚Äù/154

Globo wod:  If a suitable wall for wall walks isn't available sub either a 15ft handstand walk or 3 inch worms with pushup.  Dumbbells sub for deadlifts is 75/90lbs Dumbbells.  If a medicine ball isnt available sub for wall balls are 15/20lb dumbbells thrusters. Move explosively on these.
