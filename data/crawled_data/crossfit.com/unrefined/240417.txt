Workout of the Day

Rest Day


Today is a rest day, which alters our cadence from previous weeks in preparation for the next four days of Quarterfinals workouts.


If you are signed up for Quarterfinals, good luck! Be sure to check the CrossFit Games website for the official rules, standards, and submission deadlines. Work hard and have fun!


If you are not signed up, this is an opportunity to work out, cheer on the community, and witness the hard work and dedication so many of you have put in year after year.


Following the Quarterfinals workouts, we will rest on Monday, Thursday, and Sunday before returning to our regular three-days-on, one-day-off, two-days-on, one-day-off schedule. Buckle up and get ready to have some fun.
