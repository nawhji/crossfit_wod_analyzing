Scaling:

Today’s workout is meant to be a grind. The load of the ruck should allow you to complete at least 15-20 unbroken reps of the ground-to-overheads and to keep moving on each of the rucks. Newer athletes should move at a march pace and reduce the distance to complete each ruck in no more than 11 minutes. If you’re more experienced, feel free to pick up the pace.
