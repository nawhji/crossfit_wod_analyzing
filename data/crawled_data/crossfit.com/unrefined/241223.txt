Post loads to comments.


Stimulus and Strategy:

Today’s workout is a heavy day. Heavy is relative to each athlete. The three movements in the complex are meant to be completed unbroken and in a touch-and-go fashion. Increase the weight across each set as long as technique and safety are maintained. Rest as needed between sets.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of the lifts.


Use dumbbells to decrease the complexity of the movements.


In case of injury or limitation, perform the complex with a single dumbbell. The movements can also be broken down into bodyweight counterparts: hip extensions for deadlifts, ring rows or pull-ups for the hang power cleans, and a box jump for the power clean.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

7 sets for load of:


2
 deadlifts


2
 hang power cleans


2
 power cleans


Coaching cues:

Actively pull the barbell into your body throughout this complex. Allowing space between you and the barbell will result in inefficient movement and, often, a missed lift.
