Army Staff Sgt. Jack M. Martin III, 26, of Bethany, Oklahoma, assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, Fort Lewis, Washington, died Sept. 29, 2009, in Jolo Island, Philippines, from the detonation of an improvised explosive device. Martin is survived by his wife Ashley; parents Jack and Cheryl; and siblings Abe, Mandi, Amber, and Abi.


Scaling:

For today‚Äôs Hero workout, reduce the weight on the push presses and kettlebell swings, and the height of the box so you can perform each exercise unbroken with minimal rest during transitions. Don‚Äôt let the load keep you from moving ‚Äî the goal is constant movement for the duration of the workout.

RXd in the a.m. at the Y. With honor.
10 R + 2 PP
Stoked to hit 10 R as that was a goal from the start. Unbroken x10's, just used transitions to catch my breath and get ready. 
221029 - 9 rounds (completed again a few weeks later and only got 8 R + 7 PP)

Subbed 5 per arm DB PP at 40lb, very slight dip. 20‚Äù BJ, best I could do here. Great workout, pretty much moving the whole time, about a 15‚Äô walk between BJ and weights. Semper Fi Jack!

9 rds + 28 (finished round 10 at 20:04)
Compare to 221029: 95# PP, 35# DB Swings (heaviest and no KB), Tuck jumps (no good platform) - 11 rounds.
I consider today an improvement over the compare to and new PR - Rx KBS and box jumps this time despite less rounds completed.  BJs were full stand up and step down. Reps unbroken, just too much time spent breathing in between rounds.
Hooah SSgt Martin! RIP

Nice! I'm brand new and about to complete the beginner version. For the 10 step-ups, is that 10 total (5 per leg alternating) per round, or 20 total (10 on each leg alternating) per round? Thanks! :)
