CrossFit for the Sport-Specific Athlete


Most strength and conditioning programs are not highly sport-specific. Most programs across sports focus on general physical preparation (GPP) by building foundational athletic skills like strength, power, mobility, and endurance. While coaches teach sport-specific skills, athletes often neglect GPP, which can significantly enhance their sports performance. CrossFit, with its emphasis on functional movements, variety, and intensity, excels in developing GPP through exercises like squats, deadlifts, and Olympic lifts. By improving general athleticism, CrossFit allows athletes to train more efficiently and enhance their specific sports skills while fostering team spirit and mental toughness.
