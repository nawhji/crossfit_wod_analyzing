Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. Be sure to look back at your previous score to help you better understand your strategy for today‚Äôs effort. Choose a load that allows you to complete most of the overhead squats unbroken. The challenge of this workout is to keep an aggressive pace on each element knowing that neither the lifting nor the running are so demanding on their own that you‚Äôll need extended rests. Advanced athletes should resist the temptation to add load and instead commit to a run pace that‚Äôs just a little too hot.


Intermediate option:


5 rounds for time of:

400-meter run


10
 overhead squats


‚ôÄ 65 lb

‚ôÇ 95 lb


Beginner option:


5 rounds for time of:


200
-meter run


10
 overhead squats


‚ôÄ 
35
 lb

‚ôÇ 
45
 lb


Coaching cues:

Press up into the barbell and rotate your arms so your elbows face the ground. Do not relent on this technique throughout the workout.

Assault Nancy (scaled)
5 RFT
25 cal Assault Bike
15 OHS (35#)
16:25
Completed on 241028 after a full day of traveling.  Did not train on 241026 - too much pain in multiple joints, it was rough enough just to do normal stuff around the house.

Was way off last effort! I know why though‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt go unbroken in rds 3-5. I expected to, but it wasn‚Äôt to be. Back to working on shoulder strength/endurance.

On a treadmill, no incline.

Globo wod: if you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.  Subs for run are 500m row or 25/30 calories assault or echo bike.  Dumbbell sub single dumbbell OHS, 8 left arm and 8 right arm, 25/35 lb dumbbell.  Keep in mind that dumbbell OHS are more difficult than barbell ones so scale if needed.
