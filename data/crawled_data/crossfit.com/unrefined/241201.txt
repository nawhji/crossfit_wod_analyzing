Complex movements like gymnastics and weightlifting are crucial for improving coordination, agility, and balance, especially as neurological skills become harder to develop with age. While recovery may take longer for older athletes, proper lifestyle choices like good nutrition, sleep, and stress management allow older athletes to train hard and recover effectively, making CrossFit scalable and transformative for all ages.
