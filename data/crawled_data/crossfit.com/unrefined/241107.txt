The Primer on Protein, Part 1: What Is Food For


In "World Class Fitness in 100 Words," the first prescription for achieving fitness is focused on food, not exercise, highlighting the importance of nutrition. While food provides energy, it also offers crucial building blocks for the body, like amino acids, which form proteins essential for brain, muscle, and tissue function. This series explores how dietary protein supports muscle health, which is vital for longevity and disease prevention.

It felt good to roll out and focus on mobility this morning.

As mentioned in yesterday's post, we did a squad based bulletproof-like workout.
Squad of 3
For time complete
249 Pull-ups
249 Back squats (I used 65#)
249 Push-ups
2.49 Mile run
I completed my share in 23:35, 24:55 overall
It was designed to be done in squads of 4, but with only 3 showing today (me included), we broke the work up into 83 reps of each and .83 mile run per person.  I did my reps in rounds of 10 for the first 7 rounds, then the last being a round of 13.  Tomorrow will be a unit run.
