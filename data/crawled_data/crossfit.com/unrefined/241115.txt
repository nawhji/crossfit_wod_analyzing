Workout of the Day
117
5 rounds for time:

18/25-calorie row

25 burpees over the rower


Post times to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a gut check. Find a pace on both the rower and the burpees you can maintain and keep yourself moving. Going out “hot” on the rower does you no good if your pace slows down your burpees. Most can perform the movements as prescribed, however, consider a combination of reps and calories that allows you to finish a round in 4 minutes or less.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time:


15/20
-calorie row


20
 burpees over the rower


Beginner option:

5 rounds for time:


7/10
-calorie row


10
 burpees over the rower


Coaching cues:

On the burpees, stay low as you transition from one side of the rower to the next. This will decrease your cycle time.

Took the scaling notes about pacing to heart. Kept each row to 55-56 seconds, very deliberate on burp speed, and tried to keep rests to the duration of transitions only. Probably could have gone sub-20 Rx, but I felt it prudent to scale today. Pain is a good guide to scaling/subbing/modifying but it sucks having to use it.

18:55 normal Burpees due to gym setting today.
(I think the standard for how straight out bodies have to be a little fuzzy in Burpees over the rower / Burpees over the dumbbell as seen in the open - it should be 180° to keep the trainings consistent and comparable)

Globo wod: sub for rower are 13/20 calories assault or echo bike or 300/350m run, with burpees over a bar, low bench, or dumbbells. If you are using a conventional treadmill for runs use a slight incline

I don't have a functional rower; what's the swap? Air bike or high pulls?
