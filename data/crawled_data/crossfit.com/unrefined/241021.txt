Post total reps to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a Tabata workout. The most common one is Tabata Something Else. You will perform all 8 sets of an exercise before moving on to the next. A single set is 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. The goal is to accumulate as many reps as possible within the 20 seconds and across all 8 sets. At the end of your workout, your score will be the total number of reps you completed across all four exercises. When it comes time for the box jump-overs, the safest option is to step down. However, the choice is yours. If you do not have access to an Echo bike, use any bike or machine available.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

For total reps:

Tabata 
ring rows

Tabata box 
step-up
 overs

Tabata push-ups 
from the knees

Tabata calories on the Echo bike


♀ 12-inch box

♂ 20-inch box


Coaching cues:

If you are kipping the pull-ups, keep your kip tight and rigid for as long as possible. Jump up on the pull-up bar, put your lats in your back pocket, squeeze your legs together, and keep your belly tight. A stable connected structure will last longer.

Scaled to box step overs (24"), otherwise Rx
55-64-107-49=275
Knees were not having BJs today after hours in airplanes hence the scale.  The legs and lungs ran out of steam at the end.
