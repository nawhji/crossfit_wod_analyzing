Scaling:

Today’s workout is a fast couplet. Expect your grip to be taxed on both movements. Double-unders should not take more than 45 seconds each round. Intermediate athletes should choose a number of double-unders they can consistently achieve within 30 seconds. If necessary, reduce the reps or perform attempts for a given amount of time each round. The load of the barbell should be light. Over the course of the workout, the load may even be annoying because you want to put it down, but there is no reason to do so. Push for unbroken rounds and manage your transition times.

As many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:


15
