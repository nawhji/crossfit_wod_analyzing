As rx‚Äôd, 6 rounds.
Dubs cooperated for the most part.¬† Had 1 or 2 breaks in most rounds.¬† Rounds 5 and 6 were more of a struggle ‚Äì heart rate was jacked and I was really trying to get through that 6th round.¬† Deliberately took it easy on later rows to try to keep the heart rate down.¬† Unbroken deads.

Can't jump rope in house so I just jumped 50 times for the rope.

Completed on 240309
Subbed 100 SU for the Dubs, otherwise Rx
7 rds at the buzzer
Legs were pretty sore from Bulletproof yesterday so wasn't sure how this was going to turn out - fairly pleased with it.  Set the C2 on drag 5 and decided on a goal to keep all the rows sub 1:10 - achieved.  DLs unbroken and no trips on the SUs.  I would like to say that doing 100 SU would take about the same time for me to do 50 DUs, but that would be a lie - stringing together DUs remains elusive.  I might try the scaled version in a few days to see if I could possibly hit 8 rds.

Row was smooth. Back was residually blown up from running/KBSwings yesterday. SingleUnders were messy. DeadLift cycling felt heavier than I thought it would feel. Limiter was single unders and soreness.

As Rx‚Äôd: 5 rounds + 6 reps (60m on C2 rower). Fine with it, 5 rounds was my goal. M/45. 
Thought the DL weight would be light, but was more difficult with elevated HR from the row. DUs were rough, broke into 2 sets of 25.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead as usual. I will look to do 24.2 tomorrow.
5 Rounds for time
200m run
5 Burpee pull-ups
15 KB Swing (24kg)
10 Plank pull-thru (16kg KB) - pull a weight from left to right and back again under the body while in the plank.
14:08
5 minute rest, then
16 min AMRAP
20 DB snatch, alternating (45# DB)
10 Box jumps (24‚Äù)
10 Hand release push-ups
5rds + 20 +10 (finished rnd 6 about 30 sec later)
I intended on doing scaled 24.2 prior to Bulletproof but did not get out there soon enough.   Looking back, I don't know that I would have been able to finish Bulletproof without significantly scaling it had I done 24.2 first.  I ended up doing 1 round of scaled 24.2 afterward just to feel how it flowed.  I'm considering trying Rx weight and 100 SU when I do it - my Dubs just aren't good enough.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Hey fellas! My bad. Anyway, this month 20 years ago Coach Glassman wrote 
What is CrossFit
 in the Journal. It talks about the black box model, mixing modalities for conditioning, functional movement as physical therapy, and some great words from OGs Kelly Moore, Mark Twight, and Robb Wolf. The part I'd like to highlight talks about training intensity:
The workouts can be worked at such blistering intensity, and should be, so that on the following day some rest, or at least a change of tempo is needed. For our simple template we will call these days ‚Äúfocus days‚Äù. 
Let's look at today's workout for example: I'm not into the Open stuff at all, but I do know that Dave Castro is a master at crafting these workouts, and the opportunity will be there for you to get down. The question I ask is how many of you plan on doing this more than once? How many of you did last week's Open workout more than once? If you are a repeat Open dude, I'd like to respectfully ask you to challenge your willingness to work towards peak intensity. 10 deadlifts at 185 lbs... can you do that set in 12 seconds? How many of you have multiple speeds on double unders? A cruising speed and an I GOTTA GET 50 IN 15 SECONDS speed? The truth is I can't ever remember seeing a CrossFit Games competition on TV where I would consider the athletes to be moving at a "blistering" intensity during a workout. I don't watch them often, and I'm sure there are outliers (sandbag hill race of 2009, zig zag cone sprints) but every time I watch they move at the speed of James Harden running a fast break knowing he's so good the job's getting done regardless how fast he goes. This is probably the right thing to do when strategy plays a role in endorsement and sponsorship, but it's important to understand that some people can be so fit that their 80% effort is good enough to get results they want. I've had a belief for a while that a lot of CrossFit Games people would have trouble finding an intensity in a single, stand-alone workout that would require them to have a change of tempo the next day; I don't have evidence to back that up, or inside info, just a hunch that may be as wrong as my hunch that Harbaugh and JJ were staying at Michigan. From the looks of it, with a little curiosity and intention this workout could be a chance to practice going there.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Man, I don't even remember how I did these any more! General Fear Level somewhere in there? That grid thing? Maybe I'll just stick to the rants. Oh, New to CrossFit Scale. I'll do that still.
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Welp, as is probably. Dave's workouts are so elegant not much needs to be changed for beginners or elites. Maybe decide if you want to set time aside for jump rope practice in the warmup and just stick with rowing and deadlifts?

Good to hear from you Chris. That ‚ÄúWhat is Fitness‚Äù article blew my mind. 
In a recent podcast (recommended by Mike Andridge), Coach G‚Äôs estimate of how hard athletes push in most workouts surprised me at how low the number was.

Globo wod: Just like last week, if it's possible do this workout at an affiliate.  Check  map.crossfit.com for an affiliate near you and reach out to see when they can get you in.  If possible sign up for their "Friday night Lights".  Failing that this one is doable in a Globo if you have access to a c2 rower and can move it near your barbell.  Make sure you follow the filming instructions and movement standards at games.crossfit.com, paying particular attention to camera and floor setup so the meters on the rower can be seen by the camera, as well as your other movements.  Best bet is to do this when the gym is slow and to have a judge.  Finally, if this isn't going to work (on a cruise ship or otherwise don't have access to equipment) and you are not submitting a score subs are row 300m on a non standard rower, 250m run, or 18 calories assault or echo bike.   Dumbbells sub dumbbell deadlifts 50/70lb dumbbells. Double unders as Rxed.
