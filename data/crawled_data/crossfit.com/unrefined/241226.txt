How Fit Are You?


CrossFit’s original fitness competition, predating the CrossFit Games and Open, features five challenging tests designed to assess absolute strength, relative strength, and gymnastics skills. These tests include 1-rep-max lifts, bodyweight movements, and complex gymnastics, with scaling options available. The key goal is not just scoring but identifying weaknesses to improve over time. By working on deficiencies in strength or skill, you can make significant progress, guided by training suggestions included in the article. This approach highlights how focused efforts on weaknesses can lead to remarkable fitness improvements and long-term adaptability.

2+ hour hike in Pike National Forest with my wife and 2 dogs.  Good for the legs, body, mind and soul.  Now ready to tackle what HQ sends us this week!
