Scaling:

Welcome to the fourth and final workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! Today's workout is a clean-and-jerk ladder with ascending weights. This is a barbell stamina and conditioning test. The barbell load starts on the lighter side of moderate and builds its way up to relatively heavy. The first barbell should be a weight with which you can perform some touch-and-go reps, while the next three will require a bit more strategy. Consider performing fast singles with minimal rest between reps. If you are not signed up for the Quarterfinals, choose loads that challenge your ability but allow you to complete the reps at the first and second barbell. The third barbell should be tough to get through, and any reps with the fourth barbell should be considered a bonus.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

10 clean and jerks, weight 1

Rest 1 minute

10 clean and jerks, weight 2

Rest 1 minute

10 clean and jerks, weight 3

Rest 1 minute

Max-reps clean and jerks in time remaining, weight 4.

Scaled to Intermediate weights.¬† Got 9 reps at 185.
Set up 3 bars, but had to switch collars out because one of my good collars broke.¬† Unbroken at 115 in about 35 seconds.¬† Broke 135 6-4, but still done in 45 seconds.¬† All singles for 155, started at 6:40 and finished at 5:10.¬† Started 185 at 4:10 and did one about every 30 seconds ‚Äì barely sustainable.

Did women's Intermediate
38 reps
Had to go light because of all my joint issues.  Better to scale to weight that you are confident will not make things worse than push the envelope and likely break yourself in a way to put you out of action.  Completed on 240422 due to an all-day car repair extravaganza on 240421 and an overly tight back throughout.

Intermediate in the home gym. 225 is a PR, so yeah, not going to try and RX this thing...
42 reps.
unbroken rounds 1 and 2. after putting the first rep of round 3 right into my chin for a no rep, I slowed down and hit fast singles. I think I had about 3:30 left for 185 but it was slow singles. happy to get over 10 reps of that weight!
