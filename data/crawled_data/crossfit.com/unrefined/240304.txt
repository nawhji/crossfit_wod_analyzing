7Rds (7:00)
BoxJumps 7x7
PullUps (5,5,5,4,3,3,3) 28
Did this one as starting at sets of 5 and just pulled as many as possible in 1 set. Didn't want to stare at the pullup bar, so I just kept moving to the box jumps PullUps are tired from pullups yesterday. BoxJumps were smooth, and didn't gas me. Just kept moving for the quick work. Hit the stimulus. 
Afterwork, was hoping I forget my headphones so that I wouldn't have to workout. Put them in my shorts, so no excuses.

7 min AMRAP (scaled)
7 Box Jumps (24")
7 Jumping CTB Pull-ups
8rds + 7 + 4
Compare to 211123: same scale of jumping CTB pull-ups, but using an 18" box, 7rds + 7
Scaled the CTB again to work the ROM but also to try and reduce some strain on the elbows this time.  30" side of box was just too unstable in my garage to use Rx height.  The last time I used an 18" box to avoid stressing the back too much while recovering from injury.  I feel overall that improvement was made.

RXd ish at the Y. No box height measurements so I went with what I estimated to 30‚Äù. 
6+12 reps. 
tried to hold one round per minute but cannot maintain kipping C2B and lost time there.

Globo wod: If your pullup bar isn't suitable for kipping sub strict pullups.  If you don't have access to a box or other platform for jumps either do bench jump overs or 30/36" broad jumps as a sub for box jumps.
