The Clean: Why CrossFit Athletes Do Olympic Lifts


The July 2003 CrossFit Journal article “The Clean” highlights the clean as the "King of All Exercises," emphasizing its comprehensive fitness benefits and accessibility compared to the snatch. The clean enhances all 10 general physical skills — cardiovascular endurance, strength, power, flexibility, speed, coordination, agility, stamina, balance, and accuracy — while improving general athleticism through powerful hip extension and the coordination of complex movements. It is also a gateway to the clean and jerk, making it highly effective for lifting heavy loads. Mastering the clean with proper technique ensures athletes reap these benefits, optimizing performance in sports and functional tasks.
