Did this one as just a Murph prep workout. Most pullups volume in a while. Arms were pumped out. Don't think I've ever actually done Cindy, but I've done many rounds of pullups pushups squats.

Compare to: 220927: 23+5
May have miscounted round 3 or 4 hence the variance.  Hands and knees were feeling rough from the last 2 days, and I was just a little extra gassed in the later rounds today.  Like Jim, I finished 13 at the 10 min mark, but really started to fall off.  PR is somewhere around 25-27rds so I wasn't too far off that.

Happy with the results, but I feel like I had to dig really deep to get there, more than before. I‚Äôm gonna keep clawing to beat previous attempts, but I think I‚Äôm hitting the ceiling soon. Dammit. Still one of my favorites though.
First time doing this in 2013, I did 13 rds!

I actually made a few calls and will be having someone put butter on your pull-up bar next time Cindy comes up, just in case.

Globo wod: As Rxed for most of you. Hog a space near a pullup bar and get at it. If for some reason you don't have a pullup bar today sub either inverted rows on rings or a railing, or a barbell in a rack or Smith machine, or heavy dumbbell rows as a last resort.  If you can't kip on your globos bar or are using a door gym do strict Cindy today.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
The more I think critically about what I'm doing as a CrossFit coach, and the more variety of settings I attempt to apply CrossFit principles in, the more I realize that... hmmm... let me try this out a different way. Here's a question: if you had a group of new people and needed to get them a conditioning dose RIGHT NOW FOR THIS WORKOUT, what is the first thing that comes to your head? For me, it would be simple: 400m run repeats. If it's a group of 20 people, at leat 15 of them would find themselves gasping for breath in some capacity. Even experienced people coming in once-a-week would get a great dose out of it. But what's interesting is that Coach Glassman helped uncover that doing pull-ups, push-ups, and squats pack just as bad - or even worse - of a conditioning punch. Or, I should say, 
could possibly
 pack that punch. If I put those same 20 new people through Cindy (full ROM standards), I would bet 5 of them (at most) would get a conditioning dose. So here, again, is why I like to break things down to a few simple questions when scaling. The main one here is: are my pull-ups, push-ups, and squats good enough to be conditioning tools? Be honest with yourself, because the target audience here is for people who are scared for their lungs and head on this, not their arms and legs. If not, then simply decide if you want to keep the conditioning dose and change the movements, or keep the movements and change the conditioning dose. There's no wrong answer as long as you're aware of what you're doing. Also, Cindy is one of the most mentally challenging workouts. More so than Chad, in my opinion. It's simply the slowest 20 minutes outside of a math classroom I know of. I find a lot of success with myself and our Champions Club peeps if we don't look at the clock until about 4ish minutes left. Instead it's a race to landmarks: how quick can I finish 8 rounds? Okay, now get to 13 as fast as I can. Well, I'm basically at 20 already, so just make it to 21... and so on. Takes a lot more focus but the scores have shown good returns in the form of prs by way more than expected.
SCALING QUESTIONS
See rant.
Who is the target audience for this workout?
How much slop will I allow on my push-ups?
Cut ROM on pull-ups or go to ring rows?
Keep push-up number and lose intensity or drop the push-up number and lose the "rx"?
If quick transitions aren't available in the space you work out, would you be better off doing Candy or Angie?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
As is, just drop the intensity bigtime. Keep 20 minutes on there, though, and go slow to focus on form. Even scale to just kipping on the bar or planks holds every other round if you want
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 8

Great rant Chris--wish I read this before the wod--I sort of gave up during my unforeseen break and lost it mentally(mainly because I know how painful it can be)
The math class comment was funny!

This is all true.  But remember that the Cindy stimulus is not solely "conditioning".  I mean, that might be the main one.  But for some individuals, the stimulus might be muscular stamina (as opposed to endurance).  Or strength.  Or coordination.  Or speed.  Plus, even for those of us who have seen Cindy many times - the feeling the next day is very different than the feeling after running multiple 400's.

I'm with that Mel, and that's why I think it's important to understand who the target audience is. Like, for me, Isabel is a strength workout; a 5 or a 6 on a scale of 10. But I'm not the target audience because I'm weak as hell compared to who the workout is designed for. So when Isabel comes up, I gotta ask myself, "Do I want to continue working on the strength (do Isabel) or do I want to get that 8 or 9 conditioning dose for today (do repeat 400s or something)? My current fitness level won't allow me to have both, and many people could say the same for Cindy.

Exactly.  Every workout (well most) offers a choice - which weakness would you like to work on today.  It's up to the athlete or the coach to make smart decisions, and perhaps not always focus on one vs. another.
