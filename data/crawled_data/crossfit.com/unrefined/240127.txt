Scaling:

Expect today’s workout to fall in a moderate time domain. We are performing a lower volume of squat clean thrusters, but the challenge lies in hanging on to the barbell. A single repetition is a squat clean from the floor directly into a thruster. The bar must then be returned to the ground to begin the next rep. This workout is intended to be used with a moderately light barbell to allow for large, unbroken sets.


The runs should take no longer than 2:30. Push to complete the first 12 squat clean thrusters unbroken, or as close to it as possible. The intent of this workout is to cycle a lighter load across a large range of motion and push the pace on the runs.
