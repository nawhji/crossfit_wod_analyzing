Workout of the Day

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

2 wall walks

2 deadlifts


‚ôÄ 205 lb

‚ôÇ 315 lb


Post total rounds to comments.


Compare to 
231227
.


Stimulus and Strategy:

The goal today is to perform at least 1 round per minute. Reduce the difficulty of the wall walks to complete each round in 30 seconds or less. Loading of the barbell should feel moderate to heavy, allowing you to maintain unbroken sets for the majority of the workout.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell.


To decrease the complexity of the wall walks, reduce the range of motion by only taking two to three steps toward the wall, or performing an inchworm + a push-up.


In case of injury or limitation, perform a sumo deadlift with a barbell, kettlebell, or dumbbell in place of the deadlifts. If needed, eliminate the external loading and perform a GHD hip extension or a PVC good morning. As for the wall walks, perform an inchworm + push-up or shoulder taps in a plank hold.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

2 wall walks

2 deadlifts


‚ôÄ 
125
 lb

‚ôÇ

Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

2 
inchworm + push-ups

2 deadlifts


‚ôÄ 
55
 lb

‚ôÇ 
75
 lb


Coaching cues:

This barbell will get heavy. Take a deep breath, brace your core, and pull your shoulders back and down. Don‚Äôt get caught being lazy.

Btw for programmers, back to back shoulder days are hard on the micro muscles and joints. The med balls and then next day wall walk or inchworm. My inner shoulders are quite tender. Yes, more banding, rest, etc will strengthen over time. Thanks for listening :)

Scaled: 245# DL and WW almost to wall (10# more and closer than last time)
11 Rds
Compare to 231227: 235# and scaled WW, 12 rds.
1 less round than last time but heavier and more difficult WW so I consider today an improvement.

Wall walks...3-4 skooches toward the wall per hand, to ~20" from the wall.  Not near as vertical of a body position as in the demo video, but its what I can do!

Sounds like they have a decent setup at your resort, if they have DBs to 100#.
I'd be slower at a resort, basking  in the sunrise rather than pushing myself!

Continued testing "How Fit are You?" from Thursday.
Tabata Squat/Muscle Up: 20*13(sets of 3 pull-ups/3 dips) = 260 = 4 points 
Deadlift / Max HSPU: 310 * 11 = 3410 = 0 points. 
That D- score looking rather prescient.
