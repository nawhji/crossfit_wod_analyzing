Scaling:

Expect this workout to be a grind and taxing on your grip. Carry the dumbbells however you‚Äôd like on the weighted lunges ‚Äî consider the front-rack position, resting the dumbbells on the shoulders, or the farmers-carry position as potential options. Reduce the dumbbell load to move with limited rest on both movements. If you don‚Äôt have dumbbells or kettlebells available, load the lunges and carries with a 30/45-lb ruck or backpack. There are no excuses. If possible, consider performing this workout on a 400-meter track.


Intermediate option:

With a pair of dumbbells, 4 rounds for time of:

50-meter weighted lunge

Powergym was crowded this morning, but I had a small lane on the 25ft(?) turf. Probs should've done more lunges. I hate lunges. Need to do more lunges and add a little weight every now and then. Haven't done FarmerCarry in a while. Forearms were screaming. Gotta get carries in like once every 2weeks. 
Quick moderate squat, quick moderate squat snatch, and heavy sets of pullups,dips, shoulder press, and cable row done before, plus 1 mile easy jog conditioning after. 
Hit the grip stimulus, but missed the lunge mark. Checked the box on this one and just got in some movement after work.

Didn't expect the lunges to be the hardest part. Legs were still sore from deadlifts and front squats a couple days ago.

Did 24.1 first, results posted on 240301.  Took about a 3 minute rest and then dramatically scaled back today's WOD.
2 rounds for time, 35# DBs (heaviest I have at home)
25m Weighted walking lunge
225m Farmer Carry
~10:00
The body was cooked after 24.1 plus still feeling it from our bulletproof workout yesterday.  Shoulders started to go before the grip this time.
Compare to 210313: 4 rounds Rx distances using 25# plates, 19:02.

RXd at the YMCA. Indoor 100 m track. 
24:24.
all lunges unbroken until round 4. went from farmers carry lunges to front rack (to relieve grip) for rounds 2-4. the farmers carry's were light jogs at times to try and make at least 50m unbroken each time I picked up the DB's. after yesterdays red-liner this felt nice.
