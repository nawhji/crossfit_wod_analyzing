M/33/5'7"/218lbs
75-95-105-115-125-135lbs-145(X)-145(X)
Snatch 3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1
Can consistently hit 135lbs, but not improving on snatch pull. Can't get under 145. Need to do a snatch program/progression and get my snatch up to 165lbs where it should be.

Can‚Äôt afford CrossFit classes right now but I at least finally have a gym membership again, so I‚Äôm slowly building up my strength again. Started my workout today with back squats and then did this WOD. Probably could‚Äôve gone higher if I had done this first but I‚Äôm happy I did it at least.

Globo wod: If you are using iron plates today use a weight that you can bring down under control, perhaps doing the same weight across sets.  Another option is to do hang squat snatches.  Dumbbells sub alternating dumbbell squat snatches 4-4-4-4-4-4-4.  Warm up well before starting work sets.  Keep in mind that dumbbell squat snatches are more difficult than barbell snatches, so watch your form and take small jumps.  If you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets.
For you globo goers out there,  the Open is right around the corner.  You do have a few options if you are looking to to do the workouts.  The first one is to find a CrossFit affiliate near you  (map.crossfit.com) and reach out to see if you can join them for the workouts.   You will have a group that will push you, make new friends, and you will be able to submit a score without videoing yourself. If you can make their "Friday night Lights" even better. The second option is to video your performance. This could be difficult,  but is doable in a well equipped globo.  Go when it is slow and have someone help you film and judge if possible.  Make sure to follow the setup and filming instructions for the workout from the Games website.  Finally if that's not possible (travel, on a cruise ship,  deployed, ect) there will be options posted here. Remember that if modified outside specifications you can't post an official score.  But you can still have fun.
