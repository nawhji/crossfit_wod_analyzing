Workout of the Day
57
Complete as many reps as possible in 30 minutes of:

800-meter run

20 toes-to-bars

20/30 Echo bike calories


Post rounds and reps to comments.


Stimulus and Strategy:

Today‚Äôs workout is a longer-duration effort. All athletes should aim to complete at least 3 rounds, however, some advanced athletes may be able to knock at the door of 5-6 rounds. Choose an option for toes-to-bar that allows you to maintain consistent sets of 5 or more reps.


Scaling:

Reduce the overall duration of the workout to 15-20 minutes.


Reduce the distance of the run to something you can complete in 5 minutes or less, the number of toes-to-bars to something you can complete in 4 sets or less, and the number of calories to something you can complete in 2 minutes or less.


Reduce the range of motion of the toes-to-bars by performing knees-to-chests, hanging knee raises, or V-ups.


In case of injury or limitation, perform 800/1,000 meters on the rower in place of the run. Perform sit-ups or a 1-minute plank hold in place of toes-to-bar. Perform a 400-meter run or 400/500-meter row in place of the calories on the bike.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 30 minutes of:

800-meter run

20 
knees-to-chests


15/20
 Echo bike calories


Beginner option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 20 minutes of:


400
-meter run


10 hanging knee raises


10/15
 Echo bike calories


Coaching cues:

On longer-duration monostructural efforts, focus on maintaining better posture. Think about keeping your chest facing forward as opposed to facing the ground.

.80 mile bike ride (1 lap around neighborhood)
20 KTC

Pain, available gear and poor time management warranted scaling and subbing today. Transitions were clunky with these subs.

Sorry to see pain was a factor, but despite that & time constraints, you still got solid work in, especially after that tough BP workout Friday.üí™

*New WOD Nation rope- recommend; maybe consecutive DUs will follow?!?
