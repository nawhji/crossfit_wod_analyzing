Today's workout is in honor of Navy Lieutenant Michael McGreevy, 30, of Portville, New York, who was killed in Afghanistan on June 28, 2015. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and daughter, Molly.


Scaling:

This Hero workout is a long effort with a high volume of reps. Athletes hitting this as prescribed should aim to finish each round in 9 minutes or less. Focus on the movement you are performing on the GHD (back extension or hip extension). Most athletes deliberately scale the back extension to the hip extension to maintain intensity and achieve the stimulus of the workout. The back extension is a controlled movement with an intentional surrendering of the spine. Dose this movement judiciously. Advanced athletes may scale the volume of the back extension if they have never completed this volume. New and less-experienced athletes should consider performing hip extensions instead of back extensions, and potentially decrease the reps of each movement.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:

Run 800 meters


35
 back extensions


35
 sit-ups


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:


Jog 400
 meters


25 PVC pipe
 
good-mornings


15-25
 sit-ups


Resources:


The Back Extension


The AbMat Sit-Up

Did some Murph prep before running. Quite gassed after. Ran 2 easy treadmill miles then went into some core work. Was cramping after 2rds, so hit the eject on the workout. Core was still a little sore from earlier in the week. 
Shouldn't of ate the fries from In'N'Out at work.

25 Handstand Push-ups
25 Pull-ups
As rx'd, 20:09.
Didn’t want to do Michael, but wanted the running.  Figured this would be a challenging but doable amount of work.  Broke HSPUs 18-7 / 15-10 / 12-5-5-3.  Pull-ups 20-5 and then unbroken for last 2 rounds.  First run 3:40, then closer to 4:00.

https://usnamemorialhall.org/index.php/MICHAEL_M._MCGREEVY,_JR.,_LT,_USN
LT McGreevy died in 2005.
Lieutenant Michael M. McGreevy graduated from the Naval Academy and went on to become members of the SEALs, one of the elite fighting forces in the world.
Lieutenant McGreevy, who was the Naval Academy class of 1997's secretary, not only was popular, but also displayed scholarly aptitude, friends said. While in high school in Portville, New York, Lieutenant McGreevy wanted to take state Regents exam in German - only his school didn't offer the language. He bought German books and taught himself so well, he passed the exam.
Gary Swetland, Lieutenant McGreevy's former high school track coach, recalled the young man as one of the most determined people he ever met. He said Lieutenant McGreevy would run more than 3 miles to school each morning, to be there by 6 a.m. so that he could get in a session of strength building before classes started.
"He grew from a thin-as-a-rail, somewhat awkward teen, to an absolute physical stud of a man," said Mr. Swetland, who kept in touch with McGreevy and attended his graduation from the Naval Academy. "You felt compelled to stand and salute" when he entered a room, Mr. Swetland said.
Military friends of McGreevy described him as the embodiment of American ideals. "Hold him up as high as you can - he was a great American and a great person," said Marine Captain Aaron Shelley of San Diego, California, McGreevy's friend and freshman year roommate at the academy. "He did well in everything I saw him do - at the same time, he was very, very humble about it and was always ready to help others."
McGreevy finished first in his SEAL class.
He had been in Afghanistan since early April and is survived by his wife, Laura, and 14-month-old daughter, Molly, his mother Patricia Mackin and father Michael McGreevy Sr.
"He died doing what he always wanted to do," said former Marine Captain. Thomas Wagner, McGreevy's classmate at the academy and the president of the Class of 1997.

Rx’d: 20:21
Admittedly (after seeing results of suspects on here that I know are better athletes than me), I may have been cycling the back extensions too quickly for effectiveness, both today and in the past. It felt like I was doing them properly, as shown in the video, but I should probably do a technique spot check.

Compare to 220906: Subbed 50 Good Mornings 45#, 24:38
Compare to 210404: Same sub, but with straight leg AbMat sit-ups, 22:21
There was probably about 3 solid minutes of unavoidable transition time in there due to distance from run start/stop to where the gear was, so I will call it a 23:30 to 23:45 effort.  Also, the first time being able (i.e. having all the gear) to hit this Rx that I can recall.  Hooyah LT! RIP

Globo Wod: If your gym doesn't have a GHD machine, you can sub Roman chair back extensions, back extensions on an apparatus, barbell good mornings 45/35lb barbell,  or supermans on the floor. For GHD Situps sub either incline board situps,  weighted situps or do situps sitting perpendicular on a bench or bosu ball with your feet under heavy dumbbells and do situps touching the ground behind you, or do 2/1 abmat situps.  The Rhabdo warning applies today, if you don't do GHD situps frequently scale or sub abmat situps today!!!  Subs for runs are 1000m row or 55 calories assault/50 cal echo bike, or 2000m bike erg.    If using a  conventional treadmill use a slight incline.
