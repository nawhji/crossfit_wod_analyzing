Today’s Hero workout honors Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas J. Valentine, 37, of Ham Lake, Minnesota, who died in a training accident in Arizona on Feb. 13, 2008.


Scaling:

Today’s Hero workout is a classic couplet of thrusters and pulling. The loading of the thrusters should be light to moderate and allow you to perform the reps in 3 sets or less. For the rope climbs, 27 total reps is no joke. If you are not regularly accumulating rope climb/pull-up volume, you should scale the total number of reps to align with your capacity. Consider reps schemes like 9-6-3 or 6-4-2. If you are tackling the Rx’d volume, the first 12 reps should take no more than 6 minutes to complete.

Coaching cues:

Cut down the amount of pulls it takes to get to the top of the rope by trying to bring your knees to your elbows before you stand up and reach for your next pull.

Rx reps, scaled to 75# and lying to standing rope climbs.
8:57
Compare to 220419: Intermediate reps, 115#, subbed 5 commando pull-ups and 5 KTE per climb (no rope); 28:10
Feeling a little too rough today so scaled way down.  Did a few rounds of snatch grip DLs, shoulder press, HS holds (back to wall), and commando pull-ups afterwards just to get a little more work in - nothing crazy for weight, reps and time though.  
Sorry Senior but had to throttle back today.  RIP brother.

I think this was meant to be less of a Fran mod than a much more pull intensive workout (hence all the rope climbs), but we're honoring Tommy V nonetheless.

this is my favourite hero wod! unfortunately I had to cut it in half, I promised myself (and my wife, who wants me available for weekend hikes) that I would scale at least the first 7 wods when coming back to training this time. (last time I went straight back into unscaled wods and couldn't walk for a week, haha)
27 thrusters
17 rope climbs to 12 feet 
my technique in rope climbs has become so bad that I basically did them legless - 17:00

Globo wod: if a climbing rope isnt available sub either 3 towel pullups or 3 L-sit pullups per rope climb (intermediate 2 per rope climb rep, scaled do a pullup progression). Dumbbell sub on thrusters are 30/45 lbs dumbbells (intermediate 25/35lbs, scaled 15/20lbs dumbbells).
