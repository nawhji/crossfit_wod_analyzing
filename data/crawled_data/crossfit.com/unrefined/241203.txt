Workout of the Day

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 9 minutes of:
3 bar muscle-ups

6 box jump-overs


♀ 24-inch box

♂ 30-inch box


Post reps to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a gymnastics couplet. Simple, yet effective. Because the duration of the workout is relatively short, this is not a good workout to “try something new.” If you have bar muscle-ups and 3 reps per round is too many, scale to 1 or 2 reps per round. In this effort, you should choose movements that allow you to complete a round at least every minute. That being said, we may see scores from advanced athletes in the high teens because they are able to complete a round every 30 seconds. Push the pace from the start and don’t try to “game” this one.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 9 minutes of:

3 
chest-to-bar pull-ups

6 box jump-overs


♀ 24-inch box

♂ 30-inch box


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 9 minutes of:

3 
ring rows


3 foot-assisted ring dips

6 box 
step
-overs


♀ 
12
-inch box

♂ 
20
-inch box


Coaching cues:

The bar muscle-up tends to be elusive because unlike the rings, you must move your body around the bar. To do this more efficiently, imagine pressing the bar into your hips as you rotate around the bar.

TOTAL: 10 sets 
Intermediate 
6 sets, can’t do chest to bar pull ups so I did regular pull ups 
Beginner 
4 sets, no rings so I used TRX for rows and tricep dips on a bench with a 45lb plate. My pull-ups got sloppy so I switched

It would be cool if you kept one foot in the band while doing the step overs with the other foot, it would make you a weightless aerial act and a transition time saver.

Globo wod: if the available bar isnt suitible for bar muscleups sub burpee chest to bar pullups.  If a high enough box isnt available sub jump overs an object (such as a bench) or 36/40" broad jumps.
