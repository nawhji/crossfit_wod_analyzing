Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout challenges your upper-body gymnastics stamina. Expect the fatigue from the burpees to have a dramatic impact on the handstand walks. Advanced athletes should push the pace on the burpees and try to maintain unbroken handstand walks. Less-experienced athletes should manage their pace on the burpees and rest as needed before kicking up. If you can perform a 50-foot handstand walk but can‚Äôt complete it in under 1 minute, scale the distance. Be cautious of upper-body fatigue. If you feel like you might collapse or buckle if you kick up, give yourself a chance to recover and gain confidence before continuing. Remember to continuously press into the floor and maintain an active position. Work hard and have fun with this one.

I couldn't do 18 burpees. I only did 9, 8 and 6, with 12 meters of bearwalk between them. To do the burpee I need to put one leg back at a time. I can't do a push-up on my feet or knees. I do it leaning on my hips. Then I get up and jump. I didn't measure time.

Wow!  Feeling pretty deconditioned.  I managed the first 2 rounds RX and then hit my 30 minute time cap. 
A few years ago I managed Murph RX in 38minutes, and Sunday it took 2:20.  It is a slow process getting back to shape.  I'm going to have to finish this one off tonight, as I have to get back to work.

I always wish I had a 3 car garage. But it‚Äôs times like these I *really* wish I had a three car garage. Rearranged the garage gym so I have 15ft each direction of workable distance, that‚Äôs flat (in lieu of my long but sloped driveway). So that helped. Still lots of breaking up. And still need more practice lol. Fun one.

As promised, did FGB from yesterday instead, results there, then just practiced HS holds with shifting weight in between stretching - FGB and yesterday's Bulletproof took all of the burpees out of me.

15:30 did the burpees as prescribed but scaled the 50 foot handstand walk to 1:00 of handstand walk. Today was one of my better days of handstand walks but I still struggle with keeping good balance and forward momentum

I cannot do handstands walks and I'm new to handstands (and cross fit), so I adapted. 
I followed the burpees to a T however I did AMRAP handstand wall push ups and scaled down

Globo wod: If your globo doesn't allow handstand walks either do this outside on a flat field or hold 2 dumbbells overhead in lockout position at 60-75 percent of your bodyweight total combined weight for 60 seconds after each burpee set. If needed do the handstand walks in segments of 10-25ft to get to 50ft total.  If your globo has an open basketball court or gymnastics area use that. Burpees as Rxed.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I would urge any of you handstand walk veterans to use the movement, or rather think about the movement as a way to practice running. So once you're upside down, what's the thing that's got to move first? Yup, your hips (technically I think your GCM is elevated when you're in a handstand, but for the sake of the argument we'll still say it's the hips). That's called falling. Once you feel your weight shift forward into a fall then what direction do your hands need to move? Nope! Wrong. Not forward, but up towards your shoulder, just like your foot in running. Lift your hands, don't reach, and you'll feel slightly out of control in the handstand walk, which is good. It's also scary, which is why I am a fan of doing a somersault or two to make sure you're okay with that falling feeling and have a bail-out strategy.
SCALING CHOICES FOR HANDSTAND WALKS TO PRESERVE THE UPSIDE-DOWNNESS
Handstand hold (designated time)
Kick to handstand practice against the wall (designated practice time)
Kick to handstand practice without a wall
Somersault
SCALING CHOICES FOR HANDSTAND TO PRESERVE THE SHOULDER STIMULUS
Overhead walk with no weight (seriously, just try this for a minute: press your arms as tall as possible overhead - fight for every centimeter - elbows as close together as possible, arms as far back as possible)
Overhead walk with weight
Bear crawl
Dumbbell press
Plank hold
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
