Scaling:

In today‚Äôs workout, you have four exercises with 4 minutes at each exercise. The goal is to complete as many reps of each exercise as possible. Choose a load for the barbell that allows you to move more and stare at it less. Use the same load for both the overhead squats and the thrusters. It's OK if one feels a little lighter than the other ‚Äî this just means you should get more reps. For the barbell movements, aim for at least 7 reps per minute. On the rope climbs, choose an option that allows you to perform at least 2 reps per minute. For the wall walks, choose an option that allows you to perform at least 3 reps per minute. Keep in mind that more advanced athletes will be able to perform more reps. However, the numbers outlined above should help you choose appropriate scaling options to get the most out of the workout.

Coaching cues:

Keep the barbell over the middle of the body as you overhead squat. Press up into the bar and pull back on it slightly to keep it situated over the middle of your feet. Your ability to balance and keep a stable base will let you know if the barbell is in the right position.

M//229lbs
OH squats @155lbs = 20 reps
Rope K2E = 36 (√∑3 for rope climbs)
Thrusters @155lbs = 7 (and just as many cleans)
Wall walls = 11
OHs were particularly painful today even after a bunch of stretching. Subbed the rope climbs for rope pull-up/knees to elbow. Thrusters were a complete mess today, wrists were not having it causing a lot of pain. No issues on the wall walks
Son(17)
OH squats @135lbs = 20 reps
Strict PU/K2E = 33
Thrusters @135lbs = 18
Wall walls = 8

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead
4 Rounds for time¬†w/ 20# plate carrier (15 min cap)
200m run
10 Pull-ups
10 Burpees
20 Squats
14:30
2 min rest, then
15 min AMRAP
250m row
10 KBS (24kg, American)
10 Single arm DB snatches, alternating (45#)
15 Knees to chest
3 rds + row (finished 4th after but didn't look at the clock)
Small but fun turnout for a nice balmy push at 38 degrees F.  Didn't push the pace on any one thing.  The AMRAP got pretty grippy toward the end.

Climbing is never quick for me because my attic door is rather small, which slows both the ascent and the descent.
