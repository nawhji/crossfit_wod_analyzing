Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is meant to be a grind. The load of the ruck should allow you to complete at least 15-20 reps unbroken of the ground-to-overheads and to keep moving on each of the rucks. Newer athletes should move at a march pace and reduce the distance to complete each ruck in no more than 11 minutes. If you‚Äôre more experienced, feel free to pick up the pace.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.

Coaching cues:

Why should you incorporate rucking in your training?


Mental fortitude is a side of training often overlooked. It‚Äôs not easy to find solace in true discomfort. Rucking, however, offers the opportunity to develop both the psychological and physical components of our fitness by forcing us to dig deep through discomfort, develop grit, and come out stronger on the other side.

Completed at local track in the early chilly morning. Weighted vest at 40lbs is the heaviest I have. 
42:57
a lot of transition time getting the vest on and off from the Velcro strap system. Nice workout regardless.

No ruck, runs on the trueform:
40 ground to overheads @45 plate
1600m run
30 ground to overhead
1600m run
20 ground to overhead
1600m run
Longest run (each round and total lol) in the barefoot shoes. This is my second week wearing them. Showed myself some grace and took about 50-70 meters to walk every 400m or so. Quads started cramping up in the last run lol. Runs: 10:07 - 9:40 - 9:28
Time: 33:50

Jogged (heavy footedly) the all the way through rucks this time, which accounts for the better time. Some of these fast times y‚Äôall are posting are impressive.

No distance markers in Pike National Forest, so I modified to, with a 40# pack,
40 GTOH's (not on the clock, but took 3:45)
15 min ruck
30 GTOH's (also not on the clock)
15 min ruck
20 GTOH's (not on clock)
15ish min ruck
~47:00, not including what were in effect ruck snatches
Ruck was a pack + 2x10# DBs, 2x5# plates, 2x2.5# plates, + 2 full nalgene bottles.  Not quite wide enough to fit bumper plates.  Had to rearrange the pack after every GTOHs so it'd ride right on the back.
I gotta hit up a surplus store to find an old body armor vest +, hopefully, some training (i.e. non-ballistic) plates for it.
Rucking in a national forest isn't exactly a grind, though my traps aren't exactly used to the strap pressure.  Definitely a fun one.

Rx+'ish
Loaded my plate carrier to 40# and wore it throughout. Used a 45# sandbag for GTOH.
47:29
Compare to 240415: 41:15, same modification.
Not sure where the time went this time - GTOHs were more broken but I didn't think it took that much longer and the rucks didn't seem any slower.  Makes me think I didn't look at the clock right in April.

Lincoln, I read your conversation w/ Chris S on the compare to page.  Most interesting.  I think something like today is definitely in the functional realm, and far more real world than most of what we do, even if the strain on the body is different.  There are a lot of components to fitness, and long and slow endurance work, like this, is important, as are other exercise modalities, even as it may or may not contribute to a specific individual fitness objective (max power, quickness, speed, explosiveness, etc).  I remember spinning up for an Iraq deployment in 2006, and having to wear body armor basically 12 hrs/day.  Though I was in pretty good shape (this was my pre-CF, all running/no strength training days), but the constant grind of the load wasted my back.  Would probably be different now, but there's not much we can do to our bodies that, done right, isn't good for it.

42:05 @45 lbs 
Split times: 2:30/11/2:00/13/1:30/12. Used normal backpack filled with weight vest + weights and a plate for the ground to overheads. 
As part of my daily life, I am actually rucking a little over a mile (1650m) with 16kg/35lbs every day (by necessity). 
Thus, my backpacks break down constantly, if anyone has a recommendation for a sturdy backpack (40 liter capacity) I'd highly appreciate it. I have yet to find one that lasts longer than 2 years.

Globo wod: If a ruck or similar backpack isn't available sub vested runs 14/20lb vest if available or carry a 20/14lb medicine ball or other object. If that's not available do unweighted runs on a conventional treadmill using a high incline. Subs for ruck ground to overhead are sandbag, weight plate, or slamball ground to overheads with similar weight, or dumbbell ground to overheads 20/35lb dumbbells
