50 alternating dumbbell snatches

♂ 50-lb dumbbell and 20-lb medicine ball to 10-foot target


Post time to comments.


Compare to

.


Stimulus and Strategy:

Today’s workout is a short-to-moderate duration effort. The challenge is hanging on when you really want to rest. Aim to complete this effort in 15 minutes or less. Some advanced athletes may be able to go sub 10 minutes. Use a load for both movements that allows you to maintain large sets.


Scaling:

Reduce the overall volume by completing 20-30 reps for each movement. Reduce the loading of the dumbbell and medicine ball to maintain sets of 15 or more reps for intermediate athletes and 10 or more reps for beginners.


Reduce the complexity of the dumbbell snatch by performing a hang dumbbell snatch. As for the wall-ball shots, reduce the height of the target.


In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell snatch on the unaffected arm. If there is an overhead limitation, perform a dumbbell clean or sumo deadlift high pull. For the wall-ball shots, perform a med-ball front squat if there is an overhead limitation or a med-ball push press if there is a squatting limitation.


Intermediate option:

2 rounds for time of:

50 alternating dumbbell snatches

50 wall-ball shots


♀ 
25
-lb dumbbell and 
10
-lb medicine ball to 9-foot target

♂

-lb dumbbell and 
14
-lb medicine ball to 10-foot target


Beginner option:

2 rounds for time of:

-lb dumbbell and 
6
-lb medicine ball to 9-foot target

♂ 
15
-lb dumbbell and 
10
-lb medicine ball to 10-foot target


Coaching cues:

To maintain a better back position in the dumbbell snatch, focus on bracing your abdominals and maintaining an active shoulder as you return the dumbbell to the ground to begin the next repetition.

Scaled to 35# DB and 9' target (heaviest DB I have and 10' ceiling in the garage)
11:40
Compare to 231226: 2 rds of 25/25 same scales, 7:03 after doing 12 days.
Turned out better than I anticipated as the knees were being ornery from the start. First DB snatches unbroken, broke once on rnd 2, sets of 10 for WBS each round.

then 
35kb/20lb ball 6:14 time
Started with 25lb dumbbell for 1st round-  moved to 35kettlebell for 2nd.  
would start by going to higher weight next time - even if I don’t have the dumbbell - use the kettlebell.

Rxd at the Y. Completed after 12 days of Christmas. 
11:22
snatches: unbroken but didn’t hand pass, transitioned on the ground, 2nd round-3 sets
wall balls: 4 sets, 5 sets
2023-11:40
similar grouping in 2023, must not have been resting as long between sets? Regardless I think that’s enough squating for the day!

Globo wod: If a medicine ball isn't available sub dumbbell thrusters 15/20lb dumbbells (Intermediate 10/15lb).  Be explosive on these thrusters. Db power snatches as Rxed.
