Stimulus and Strategy:

This variation of the classic workout Nicole calls for strict pull-ups. Use the run as recovery for the next set of pull-ups. Athletes should aim to complete around 6 sets within the 20-minute workout.


Scaling:

To limit the total amount of volume, you can “cap” your pull-ups in each round. For example, perform only 3-5 strict pull-ups per round instead of pushing to failure.


If you have strict pull-ups but are unable to perform at least 5 reps, begin each set with a max set of strict pull-ups, and then stay on the bar for a max set of kipping pull-ups. If you do not yet have strict pull-ups, perform a moderately challenging version of banded strict pull-ups or ring rows.


In case of injury or limitation, perform 800/1,000 meters on a bike or 400/500 meters on a rower. For the strict pull-ups, you can perform a single-arm dumbbell bent-over row.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:

Run 400 meters

Max-reps strict pull-ups + kipping pull-ups


*If you have strict pull-ups, but are unable to perform at least 5 reps, begin each set with a max set of strict pull-ups, and then stay on the bar for a max set of kipping pull-ups.


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:

Run 400 meters

Max-reps banded strict pull-ups


Coaching cues:

Strict doesn’t mean slow. Pull your chin over the bar quickly by driving your elbows to the ground and keeping a tight body position.
