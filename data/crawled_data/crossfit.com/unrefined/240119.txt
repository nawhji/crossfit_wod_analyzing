Scaling:

Today’s workout is a grind. How far into the “pain cave” do you want to venture? There are two ways to attack this workout: Sprint each effort and bank as much rest as possible before the next interval, or move at a moderate pace and try to sneak by each minute. If you finish the round of 20, your workout is over.


Intermediate option:

Every 1 minute complete:


9/12-calorie
 Echo bike

Complete as many rounds as possible until failure or until you reach 20 rounds.


Beginner option:

Every 1 minute complete:


6/9-calorie
 Echo bike

Complete as many rounds as possible until failure or until you reach 20 rounds.

M/33/5'7"/217lbs
7Rds  Beginner 
EchoBike Cals 9 ~ 0:30
Did this one as a conditioning piece after heavy squats, assecories, and a burpees/pull-up workout (240117) earlier. Was gassed after burpees workout, and then did some quick assecory work and then hit this one to finish leg/conditioning day. 
Knew my echo lactate turnover is lacking , so I chose the beginner option (ugh). Programmed 20 intervals into the bike and wanted to see where I landed. Chose to sprint and rest. Took the exit after round 7 as I was now running on empty, but not redlined. 
Saving this one in my echo condition files. Want to redo for sure.

Completed at the Y on 1/24. Used assault bike. 
3 rounds rxd, failed at 13 on round 4. 
lowered it to 10calories for the remaining 16 minutes, or 40s on 20s off. 
191 cals total, 5.7 miles. I don’t think I hit 10 cals that first minute of the tabata looking at that total!

-4’9”, so used to scaling the bike
-Got 10 calories in 45 seconds first round, so made 10 calories my goal/round.
-After 4 more rounds, I did not think I was going to finish, but I focused more on strategizing my pace each round and got through all 20 minutes, even hitting 11-12 calories the last 4 rounds!

Went for 10 cals/min. 
Willingly stopped after 15 min. Should have gone for 12 cals/min, 15 would definately have been too much for my build and fitness level.

Idk about my air bike, I've assumed that it is 3X off so each round was 5-6cal, a total of 124cal which would be about ~372cal 🤷🏻‍♂️. Each round took about 40sec, half off the seat, half on.
