Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is another weightlifting and gymnastics couplet. It is actually a play on Wednesday’s workout. On Wednesday, we had movement interference with the pull of the deadlift and the pull of the strict pull-up. It was also very grippy.


Today, you will find movement interference with the pressing in the overhead position of the snatch and the pressing of the strict handstand push-up. The power snatch loading should be moderate and allow you to perform a few touch-and-go reps, as well as a few singles here and there. For the strict handstand push-ups, we recommend you be able to perform consistent sets of 5 reps unbroken if you are going to tackle the prescribed number of reps.


Movement interference is not something programmed regularly as it tends to slow us down and decrease intensity. However, movement interference does a great job of building muscular stamina and endurance.

Coaching cues:

Just because a movement is strict does not mean it has to be slow. As soon as your head touches the ground on the strict handstand push-ups, squeeze everything tight, push your hands into the ground, and push your head through your arms to finish the rep.

As rx'd, 19:10. 
Snatches were rough!  Had several misses where I rushed it and didn’t quite get under.  Did all singles.  HSPU were 11-6-4 / 10-5 / 9.

Beginner reps and movements, 75# BB for both, did not push the pace focusing on technique.
6:10
6 days straight, so wanted to get in something more along the lines of active recovery.  Played around with some piked pushups (24" box) and DUs after followed by scales, stretching and foam rolling.  Still a good shoulder pump despite the lighter weight and slower pace.
