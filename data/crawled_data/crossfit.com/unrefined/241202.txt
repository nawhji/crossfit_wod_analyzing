Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout pairs a weightlifting element with a monostructural element. The row distances are short enough that they deserve to be pushed and not paced. The loading of the overhead squat sits on the light-to-moderate side. The barbell should be taken from the floor and the weight you choose should allow you to complete your reps in 2 sets or less. The goal is less looking at the bar and more moving it. The final row should be an all-out sprint!

Coaching cues:

To increase your stroke rate, perform a big, strong drive and pull. On the return, get the hands away from the body, lean in toward your toes, and use your legs to pull your body back into the catch position.

Cloud-based systems and remote monitoring are helpful for dental practices by improving efficiency and access to data. However, personal interaction and on-site involvement are still key for driving meaningful change and building trust. Balancing technology with hands-on support ensures better results.

Today's workout combines rowing with overhead squats for a challenging mix of cardio and strength. Push the row and focus on efficient movement during the lifts. Choose a weight that allows controlled reps. Sprint the final row for a strong finish!

Very slow transition from rower to bar (40s-50s recovery) otherwise as ordered: no more than 2 segments per OHS set (13+8 - 11+4 - 9). 65lbs may be my current limit for 21 reps.

19:59 lots of subs in Goodlettsville. 33 degrees. 
Hang half power/half squat snatches for OHS. Planned on subbing sumos for row, but after first round, subbed 600,400,200m runs since my back has been sore. Worked me pretty good, was able to get deeper into the catch than I have in a while, even with the short bar. Wasn‚Äôt rushing, wanted good reps.

My body was fighting back hard today. A lot of time spent staring at the bar and having internal arguments over starting another set of OH squats.

O/H work is my Achilles heel. Has been so for some time. And I don‚Äôt have an Oly bar at home.
Rowed the as Rx‚Äôd distances.
OH squat with 25# KB alternating arms.
I may invest in a bar and some weights.

Intermediate right after 241129. That‚Äôs enough rowing for one day. 
17:28. 
probably stared at the bar too long but the rows took out my lungs.
