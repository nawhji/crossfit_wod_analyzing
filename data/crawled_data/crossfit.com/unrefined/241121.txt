Primer on Protein, Part 5: Antioxidants


Part 5 of the "Primer on Protein" series focuses on the role of protein in the body’s antioxidant system. CrossFit’s nutrition prescription emphasizes protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy, which provide essential amino acids that help the body build tissues, hormones, and immune cells. A key component of the body’s defense against oxidative stress, caused by free radicals, is the production of antioxidants like glutathione and melatonin. Consuming enough dietary protein supports the body's ability to fight oxidative stress, helping to protect against chronic diseases, aging, and injury while enhancing overall performance.
