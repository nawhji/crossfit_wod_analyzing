Scaling:

In today‚Äôs gymnastics couplet, you can choose your own adventure ‚Äî break the two exercises up and alternate between them however you need. Expect muscle fatigue to be a factor in this workout. Advanced athletes can try to maintain larger sets on the bar muscle-ups, while less-experienced athletes may choose to break the two movements into sets that minimize fatigue and allow for minimal rest. Breaks and rest periods are inevitable, however, aim to avoid hitting failure on either movement.


Intermediate option:

For time:


70
 burpees to a target (6 inches above your reach)


35
 
chest-to-bar pull-ups


Alternate and break the two exercises up into as many sets as needed to complete the workout as quickly as possible.


Beginner option:

For time:


50
 burpees


25
 
jumping pull-ups


Alternate and break the two exercises up into as many sets as needed to complete the workout as quickly as possible.

M/33/5'7"/218lbs
E3MOM 7Rds ~ (20:00)
Burpees 70 (10 )
WidePullUps 30 (5,5,5,5,4,3,3)
Did this one in 7 sets of 10 burpees and 5 pullups. Did not want to redline but wanted volume. Sets of 10 were faithful burpees with enthusiastic jump. PullUps were wide and tough. Biceps were already fatigued from 30 pullups yesterday. Gassed by the end and PullUps went to failure. Work and rest was probably close to 1:1.5 (1:15,1:45). Good conditioning piece. Good burpees volume. Good pullups to failure. 
Today was pushups/Squats, row2K, Isabel, core, then conditioning. 1.75 hours quick.

32 minutes.  I have to admit, that my feet touched the wall on every muscle up, so these were definitely assisted.  But it still felt brutal.

No time for a real warm up and had a time cap of 15:30. I only made it through 12 rounds of 6x burpees (to a target line ~12" above reach) & 3x BMUs = 78/36 or 80% of Rx

Scaled and +
90 Burpees to target (but to 15" target above reach)
45 CTB pull-ups
15:39 (rounds of 10 and 5 respectively)
The target was to a beam in the ceiling of my garage (lowest thing hanging where something wasn't in the way) - I definitely felt that extra 3 inches.  Pull-ups were more of practice getting as high as possible on the bar than for speed, hence the sets of 5 were broken too.  I intended on stopping at the intermediate rep limits but hit those and decided "hey, why not do more"?  Like Chris S. has said, "you can always do 1 more burpee".

45 chin ups - tried to get chest to bar - not great form. Probably a few no reps in there. 
Started out doing EMOM alternating 10 burpees and 5 chin ups. Pushed through the last set to finish just under 17.

RXd in the home gym. Went with 2 burpees and 1 BMU for 45 rounds after seeing Patrick‚Äôs breakdown. 
30:29. 
two failed BMUs needed to be redone. This is the most BMUs I‚Äôve ever done in a workout (I recall 30 for time in 2021) so it was more of complete than a sprint. Breaking 90 burpees over 30 minutes makes them a lot more tolerable‚Ä¶.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Hey fellas, attempting to get back at it here... I've been following year-to-date from 2004 for both myself and for the Champions Club. Any noteworthy workouts come up on here in the last week? No? You sure? Well, if you say so, then we'll bring up the 20-year CFJ article for April, which is 
The Moves
. And if you don't mind, allow me address it in the only writing style I know, which is about as direct and straightforward as those stupid figure-8 intersections Michigan put in for the 12 mile and 14 mile on ramps to I-75.
About a year ago I had the idea that a lot of my messages aren't received as well as I'd like in the gym because I am 
competing for attention
 (mostly w/f safe), and am vastly outnumbered. Let's say I give an awkward lecture about someone's work ethic, or have a focused conversation with someone on their nutrition; the message is received well there but then they go to the car and flip on their phones, or go back home and scroll through pages and pages of information - some relating to fitness and some not - that push the gym conversation back in their brain. It's not completely lost the next day, but it's definitely not picking up where we left off. So earlier this month I decided that if I'm going to ask my people to subtract some of their media-consuming tools, I need to as well. I started leaving my laptop at the gym about a month ago, and then realized that we were in Lent, so figured I might as well just keep it going until Easter. While I don't have any Instagram or Facebook or whatever accounts, I really can get lost in the archives of CrossFit. I used to think that was a good thing, but how often was I pushing lessons learned at the sessions that day in the back of my mind?
I was brought up a Catholic lad with school uniforms and demerits, so you know I learned early on to give something up for Lent. Then at some point along the way someone told me to "do" a thing every day instead of giving something up; this usually resulted in something arbitrary like making my bed or putting the toilet seat down - and along the way I just kinda stopped doing things for Lent. Keeping my laptop at the gym went back to a major coaching lesson passed down from people like JoePa, Chip Kelly, Larry Brown, and Coach Glassman that subtracting is often better than adding. Less availability on the laptop meant more time in thought about the people who were actually in front of me that day, and more purposeful clicking when I did fire the laptop up at the gym during off-hours. I had no idea what was happening in the world before Lent, and I have even less now. It's hard to explain, but the tradeoff for that has somehow come with more progress as a coach, and I don't think that's a coincidence. This, of course, brings me to Coach's April 2004 CFJ article.
The traditional process of coaching human movement involves the coach first demonstrating a sought after skill and the athlete then attempting the skill after which the coach provides corrections and the athlete again performs the skill hopefully incorporating the coach‚Äôs inputs. Iterations of these steps are the essence of not only coaching human performance but all teaching as well. The challenges to applying this familiar process through the Internet and digital media are nettlesome yet fully manageable.
As a coach I need to really come to terms with my identity and what makes our gym special. In, say, 2015, I talked and talked and talked about having great people in our group and a teenage crew that was as good as there was around, but if I'm being real I put more time into running our website outside of session hours than keeping up with our people who needed it. The Champions Club was better online than it was in person. That is... not okay if my identity as a coach is being a teacher. But man, I do love the history of our site. I love some of the things I wrote and I think our peeps have also made great contributions to it as well. Plus all the workouts are recorded on there.
Right now I have zero interest in the content currently coming from CrossFit.com. I wish that wasn't the case, and in fairness to HQ, it's hard to follow Coach, and all of his Messperts just followed him to Broken Science, but I did hear something interesting when... man I'm a nerd... I was watching the Steve Jobs movie with the writer's commentary turned on: he said something to the effect of "audiences like to work, not just be given everything." In the last year or so I've really enjoyed digging back in the archives for stuff. It reminds me of a time when all we had to go on was like 4 pictures of a clean, and we'd have to work like hell to piece together the rest. I pulled up tons of threads from the old Message Board (which is still up) and found great comments under the daily WODs (using the Wayback Machine) that have all given me a much deeper understanding of where the workouts were in 2004 and what I am looking at when I see a workout posted today.
One of the mistakes I made early on as a coach was trying to just give people the answer right away; if they moved bad or missed a lift then that must mean I'm a bad coach. But recently I've been more comfortable finding that touch to give them juuuuuust enough to keep exploring on their own but not enough to ensure they'll succeed in that instant: they have to work for it. In fact, this is the only thing I think Coach might have missed the mark on in the article:
We can together build and support a community whose works are beyond the talents, genius, and capacities of anything seen before. Let‚Äôs get at it.
I think "works" should have been changed to "work ethic." And in particular, it was our work ethic to learn. We were rabid students scratching and clawing for every bit of grainy video or tiny thumbnail we could click on. The original CrossFit website was set up for us to not only work like never before physically, but mentally as well. Even the off-topic Rest Day posts challenged us. Luckily, all that stuff is still in the archives if we are willing to go digging, and I think you'll find it even more relevant today than it was 20 years ago.

What part of this is shaded towards getting better at CrossFit and what part is getting better at fitness in general?
Plan ahead of time or break it up by feel?
Honor system on the burpee jump (more than 12 inches) or keep the target?

thanks for your rant, Chris! I totally agree with digital consumption, I also try to disconnect from the web from time to time! with regards to the old archives, how do you think mainsite programming has changed over the years? I saw a comment by Everett and it seems like in 2008 there was a focus on heavy days due to the influence of Ripetoe, did you notice any other trends?

Nice rant Chris--only thing I have to add is back in the day never knowing exactly what time the next day's wod would be posted:)  My poor family--I'd be checking every 10 minutes until it was posted--now they just know--at 8:02pm I'm checking the wod:)

Patrick, I need to get better at putting it into words because right now it's more of a feel thing. The best way I can see it now is a workout like today would have probably been something like 5 rounds for time of: 30 box jumps, 30 push-ups, 30 pull-ups if it were 2004-2008. If it was 2019-early 2020 it would have been SLIPS then AMRAP in 20 minutes of: 5 strict muscle-ups, 10 burpees with an honest jump. Those two options, to me, seem more geared towards improving overall fitness, whereas today's workout seems to be geared towards being able to hang with the group in a CrossFit competition (although, I am a BIG fan of the choosing your own adventure style of workouts.) The biggest shift I ever noticed was in the ballpark of the one you mentioned; in 2008-2009 there was a major emphasis on heavier movements, but I don't think that was from Rippetoe, I think that was from the 2008 CF Games being all short and heavy due to more people signing up than they were ready for. Then when Every Second Counts came out it made that area of CrossFit really appealing to people, myself included. Speed is the most common thing lost when doing workouts geared towards CF competitions. I've said it before but 23 Tabata squats is waaaay harder than 22.5 Tabata squats in the same way a 51 sec 400m is waaaay harder than a 51.5.
Mike, man that refresh button never had to work so hard. I would never go to sleep without knowing, which sometimes ended up ruining my night when Fight Gone Bad would come up on the screen.

Chris, simply awesome as usual my man! I really do need to go back and read more of the OG stuff. But, I often find myself busy with 'other things' - I will do better.  I will say that this last week was noteworthy by having a benchmark lady programmed for every training day - it was brutal and a great week for testing progress in fitness.  I would try to point out shifts in programming and mainsite focus over the years as has been done before, but I couldn't do it better than you.

Globo wod: If your pullup bar isn't suitable for bar muscleups sub 90 chest to bar pullups if subbing for the Rxed version.   If the bar isn't conducive to kipping sub 90 strict pullups.  Intermediate sub 35 strict pullups if the bar isn't conducive to kipping.  If you don't have bar muscleups or can do them but can't string them (less then 2 full rounds in 24.3) and can do kipping chest to bar pullups well spend 10 minutes on bar muscleup techniques then do 90 burpees to bar 12" over reach and 60 chest to bar pullups.
