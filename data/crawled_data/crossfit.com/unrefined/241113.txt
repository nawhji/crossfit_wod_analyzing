Workout of the Day

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

4 kettlebell snatches, right arm

4 kettlebell snatches, left arm

12 medicine-ball cleans


‚ôÄ 35-lb kettlebell and 14-lb medicine ball

‚ôÇ 53-lb kettlebell and 20-lb medicine ball


Post rounds and reps to comments.


Scaling:

In today‚Äôs workout, there is no reason to stop. You will be moving constantly for 8 minutes. The loading of both the kettlebell and the medicine ball should allow you to perform unbroken reps throughout the entire workout. Come out fast and hang on. Remember, even though you are trying to move quickly, don‚Äôt cut the range of motion short on either movement. If you feel like you are out of control, slow down and dial in your technique before trying to speed back up.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

4 kettlebell snatches, right arm

4 kettlebell snatches, left arm

12 medicine-ball cleans

Coaching cues:

As you transition the kettlebell from a swing to the overhead position, loosen up your grip, punch the hand to the sky, and the thumb should finish pointing behind you. This transition is quick and the kettlebell should swing into position against the back of your forearm.

As rx‚Äôd, 7 rounds + 6 medball cleans (154 total reps).
Was on pace for 1 round per minute, but dang if those medball cleans weren‚Äôt frying my quads and lower back.¬† Lost the pace in round 5 or 6 and couldn‚Äôt recover.  Did after heavy deads.

Rxd at the Y. 20 lb slam ball used. 
6R + 8 + 6
finished the last 6 squat cleans after. Still dealing with grip issues made the snatches slower than just gripping and ripping.

After round 3, I dropped the med ball after the stand up in the clean. Bent-over pick up, then did the squat clean. Saved the legs big time.

Rx 5 rds
Med Ball cleans were the crux. Just couldn't seem to get through them fast - legs (especially knees) are still feeling wrecked from Chad and the lungs weren't there today.  Might have done intermediate had I had access to that weight KB. It was 24 or 16kg, no in between, and the 16 just felt too light in the warmup.  Hindsight: maybe could have squeezed in more with the 16kg but glad I stuck with the 24.
