Workout of the Day

30-20-10 reps for time of:

Echo bike calories

Pull-ups


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a sprint. No holding back. It‚Äôs a day to push the pace on the bike and larger sets on the pull-ups. That said, know your limits. If you feel like you need to break on the pull-up bar then do so. Adjust the number of calories, the number of pull-ups, and difficulty of the pull-up to keep your overall time to 10 minutes or less.


Intermediate option:


20-15-10
 reps for time of:

Echo bike calories

Pull-ups


Beginner option:
.


15-10-5
 reps for time of:

Echo bike calories


Ring rows


Coaching cues:

For those performing kipping pull-ups, focus on keeping your feet slightly in front of your body as you push away from the pull-up bar to maintain balance.


Resources:


Rogue Echo Bike


The Kipping Pull-Up


The Butterfly Pull-Up


The Ring Row

As rx'd, 7:17.
Woof, that was painful.  Pushed pretty good on the bike; I usually suck on that.  Pull-ups were 20-10 / 13-7 / unbroken.

Used green band to assist with pull ups
And I used rowing machine for calories due to me not having access to the assault bike.

Excellent time, with a lot of back work.  I've never used an echo bike, but my pull-ups got ragged the further into this workout I got, after some  hard rowing.

Yesterday‚Äôs article on deadlift got me interested in something I haven‚Äôt done in over 5 years‚Ä¶
Deficit deadlift 10-10-10
115-165-185#
Standing on a small platform of 4x4s I made about 10 years ago. 
We probably should do them every fourth or fifth DL workout for the extra stretch and extension in the hammies, and to expand the range of our strength. Then
30-20-10 cal rows
20-15-10 pull-ups

Jonathan, I don't think the article talked about deficits...it just got me thinking about them, b/c I was recently visited by a son in law who's DL strength exceeded my available weights...so I recommended DDL's to him.
Lincon, I only did a few, at light weight, to see how they felt.  Looking at my notes from the past, my DDLs were only about 20# below my normal DL weights.  I opted to not go hard, expecting HQ has deads in our near future.

Performed CrossFit Warm-Up before hopping into today‚Äôs WOD after training legs & triceps for an hour, scaled it to my abilities as pull-ups are still hard but I want to work on them rather than do ring rows.
15-10-5 reps for time:
Assault bike calories
Assisted pull-ups
Time: 7m28
Today‚Äôs workout was definitely a sprint, glad it came with a 10 minute time cap cause I was a little pressed for time! Struggled to do the pull-ups unbroken after doing a couple dozen during the CrossFit warm-up, but overall it went pretty well. Could‚Äôve MAYBE pushed an intermediate WOD today but didn‚Äôt wanna go too intense given pull-ups are still very much a weak point of mine. Might try intermediate on the next WOD that has pull-ups and just stick to assisted ones!

Well done! That rower plus the pull-ups probably changed the dynamic a bit. I'm pretty sure I would have got through the cals faster with the rower (and considered it), but it likely would have impacted my pull-ups in a different way.

Combining the intensity of the Echo bike with the strength-building power of pull-ups is a killer workout duo! The Echo bike torches calories while pull-ups target the upper body, making for a full-body burn that‚Äôs sure to challenge even the fittest athletes.

Intermediate, 20-15-10
Echo Bike cals
Pull-ups
10:07
Did this on an Echo/Assault style bike by Hammer Strength.  I've used Echo and Assault more recently and I think that Hammer Strength bike was way more frugal with calories based on the time and perceived effort it took to get them - or maybe I was just weak sauce this morning.

My rower is definitely stingier with calories than meters! üòÇ This is still a good time!  Nice work.

Who knows what programming these companies use to approximate cals burned.  My guess is, watching your strength and workouts for a while, is that Hammer strength‚Äôs algorithms are quite different from Rogue‚Äôs.

Steven, did you try opening the "Explore Workouts" page under the Workouts banner on this site?  That will typically load fully.

You can also sign up to receive emails in the link below, or follow them on Instagram. The WOD posts there reliably as well.

Today's workout is a fast-paced sprint to test your endurance and power. Push hard on the Echo bike and aim for bigger sets on the pull-ups. Scale as needed to keep your time under 10 minutes. Focus on form, especially with kipping pull-ups, to maintain efficiency!
