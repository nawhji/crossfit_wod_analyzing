Sara Wilkinson, CrossFit, and Rogue Fitness present the Hero workout CHAD1000X in honor of Navy SEAL Chad Wilkinson who died by suicide on Oct. 29, 2018, due to the effects of numerous deployments, several TBIs, blast-wave injuries, and PTSD. Our goal is to honor Chad‚Äôs life and legacy, and to raise awareness for suicide prevention.

Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a long grind. Complete as a team, with a partner, or individually for time. Reduce the load and height of the step-up as needed. If you have completed this workout previously, look back and use that information to help you tackle today‚Äôs effort.


Intermediate option:

For time:

1,000 weighted step-ups

‚ôÄ 
20
-lb ruck, 
you pick the height of the step-ups

‚ôÇ 
30
-lb ruck, 
you pick the height of the step-ups


Beginner option:

For time:

1,000 
unweighted
 box step-ups


No rucksack, you pick the height of the step-ups.


Coaching cues:

During each step-up, focus on keeping your knees tracking in line with the toes and standing up by taking your chest to the sky. These two points will ensure the best posture and mechanics throughout the workout.

350 reps with a 20# vest on a 16‚Äù box, then 650 reps without the vest, all completed in 1:12:31. Kept steady in HR zone 4 once there, adjusting speed to maintain it‚Äîno breaks except for removing the vest!

RXd in the garage gym. 40 lb best with a 5 lb change plate stuffed between vest and chest. 
72:08. 
221111-59:40 w/ 20lb vest.
figured I‚Äôd give the RX weight a go and it was quite a bit more challenging. Had a few quick breaks but still overall a real test physically and mentally. give it a go if you are able and want a challenge!
RIP Chad.

This year I completed CHAD with the prescribed 45lbs but stepped up to a 24‚Äù box. The extra distance was a bear! Sending all my love to the Wilkinson family and others who have been affected by suicide. RIP CHAD.
