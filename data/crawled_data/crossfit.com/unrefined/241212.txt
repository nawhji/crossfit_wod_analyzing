Hitting the Stimulus in Every CrossFit WOD


Intensity and variance are essential to CrossFit programming, driving results and fostering broad fitness. Preserving the intended stimulus of each workout ensures we optimize both elements. Factors like how a workout feels, loading, timing, volume, and movement patterns play a crucial role. The math method helps scale workouts to maintain intensity, guiding athletes to hit the desired time or rep targets. Whether tackling Fran, Cindy, or Amanda, scaling appropriately ensures athletes achieve the intended stimulus, maximizing fitness and results over the long term.

This article really emphasizes the importance of maintaining the right intensity and variance in every CrossFit workout. It‚Äôs crucial to scale workouts correctly to ensure that we‚Äôre hitting the right targets, whether it‚Äôs time or reps. I like how the math method is mentioned as a way to guide athletes to maintain the right level of intensity. The examples of classic CrossFit workouts like Fran, Cindy, and Amanda really highlight how scaling can help ensure we‚Äôre getting the most out of each WOD. This insight helps me better understand how to approach workouts for maximum results.
