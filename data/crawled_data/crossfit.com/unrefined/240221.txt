Did this one after work. Gassed and forearms were pumped out. All DeadLift and jerks unbroken. Had to break up HangCleans (6,3) after 1st round. Hand bone got tweaked from barbell bounce. Good quick barbell cycling.

Scaled to 105#
9:07
Compare to 220922: scaled to 85#, 6:23 (or at least that's what I recorded)
Had to make a choice: use the same scale as last time and try to be the time, or up the weight and see where it falls.  First round went completely unbroken through all reps, the rest were 12 DL with short grip break followed by unbroken through HPC and PJ.  Grip was the biggest limiting factor today, but I also just didn't seem to have much in the tank either.

RIP DT
Rx’d: 13:59 (PR)
15:24 (previous PR)
200922: 17:00
I tried a different tactic this time where I tried shorter sets on the HPC and shorter rests and didn’t try to string together long sets until the push presses. I’m not sure if that was in the spirit of the programming, but it’s what I did. I think the improved time came from the shorter rests because the effort felt the same, but I’ll take it.

Tweaked my back yesterday, so I opted out of DT today…which also pains me, b/c I hate not being able to honor these heroes. Maybe tomorrow, if the back cooperates. 
So…bench press 5-5-3-3-3-3
125-130
130-135-137(2)-135#
All rounds, including warmups, followed by 20 walking lunges…120 total. 
61/5’8”/154

Rxd. At the Y. 
14:09. 
tried to methodically pace but the power cleans caught up by the 3rd set. 11, 1-8, 1-1-6. Push jerks in two sets on the 5th round. 
was getting some dirty looks for dropping the weight….

Globo wod: If you have a bar and bumper plates you're good to go.  Just hog an area or platform and get at it.  If you are using iron plates today use a weight you can control without dropping. Dumbbells sub 40/60lb dumbbells.  If using 35/50lb dumbbells due to availability add an additional round.
