Developing CrossFit Coaches for Lifelong Career and Success


Coaching in CrossFit is a continuous journey of growth and development, where success relies on fostering critical thinking, lifelong learning, and giving constructive feedback. Elite coaches like Nicole Christensen exemplify the importance of always evolving, understanding that even with years of experience, there is more to learn. Structured feedback, ongoing education, and embracing responsibility are key components in developing great coaches who not only improve their own skills but also enhance the gym experience for members. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and mentorship, CrossFit gyms can ensure long-term success and stronger athlete-coach relationships.

Nicole is awesome, had her for my L-2. The look she gave me during squat therapy, I’ll never forget it, she makes tall people believe they can move perfectly.
