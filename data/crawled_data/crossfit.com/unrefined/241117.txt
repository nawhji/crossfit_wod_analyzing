The Primer on Protein: Part 4 - Joints


Part 4 of the "Primer on Protein" series focuses on the importance of dietary protein for maintaining healthy joints and connective tissues. Protein, particularly collagen, plays a crucial role in supporting tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and fascia, which enable smooth and pain-free movement. Collagen is built from amino acids like glycine and proline, found in foods such as slow-cooked meats, bone broth, and skin-on poultry or fish. Without adequate intake of these collagen-building nutrients, connective tissue can weaken, leading to joint pain, stiffness, and an increased risk of injury or osteoarthritis. By consuming protein-rich foods, we ensure strong, flexible, and resilient connective tissue, promoting long-term health and mobility.
