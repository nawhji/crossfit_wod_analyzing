Workout of the Day
140
For time:

1-mile run


Post times to comments.


Compare to 
211030.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a single, all-out monostructural effort. Most athletes can complete this as prescribed. Be sure to spend significant time warming up, moving your body, and elevating your heart rate. Advanced athletes should push hard and take chances. Less-experienced and newer athletes may need to jog or walk, but should be able to complete the distance.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.


Beginner option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.


Coaching cues:

Find yourself bent over at the hip when you run? This will reduce speed and efficiency and lead to more fatigue. An immediate fix is to think about keeping your chest up and leading with your hips as you run. A longer-term fix is to prioritize recovery, hip stretching, and frequent breaks for those sitting for long periods throughout the day.

(M)/31/6'2/90kg 
Round one - 7:13
Switched to intermediate due to time being over 5 min.
Round two - 4:56
Round three - 4:20 but failed to complete squats in less than 3 broken sets so reduced future amount
Round four - 08:20 " chinups "
Round five - 5:48
Average round time: 6min 7 seconds.

I didn't do sit-ups, rather I did a Champions Club Special of mixing different core moves to get to 40. Hollow rocks, v-ups, scissor kicks, that sort of thing.

Kipping pull-ups, and butterfly AbMat sit-ups. Each exercise unbroken. I may have done a few extra sit-up reps in the first round since it didn't feel that much slower than the others.  Knees and elbows didn't have a full Barabara in them this morning. Sit-ups got a little ugly toward the end.

On the trueform

in the barefoot shoes. I think that‚Äôs a trueform PR. Last mile run was for 241022 on an assault runner, did that in 7:46. Don‚Äôt recall it being as tough as this. Thinking the trueform is the tougher apparatus to move maybe‚Ä¶

7:17 as measured with uncle Google.
Can't find any compare to data, so establishing a recorded PR for 'this phase of my life' as Jonathan put it. This is far off my lifetime PR, but a shade better than expected given my significant reduction in running and persistent knee pain issues. Did pose drills (still trying to get this method down) as part of warmup, and ran an additional .61 miles and more pose drills as part of cool-down.

Globo wod: as rxed.  If using a conventional  treadmill use a slight incline.  Subs are 2000m row or 100 calories assault/echo bike, or 100 burpees if you are on a boat or somewhere without running space and no equipment.
Busy gym: run on a track, outside, or grab a treadmill and do it.

Nice! Congrats on the PR! Give those kids extra work when they're off break for the "old" bit. Plus you got faster; so older is better by that math üòâ
