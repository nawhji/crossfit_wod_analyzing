Stimulus and Strategy:

Today‚Äôs workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken ‚Äî more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.


Scaling:

The exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges ‚Äî anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).


To reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform an inchworm. On the burpees, perform an up-down. On the handstand push-ups, perform a dumbbell shoulder press or pike push-up. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target or do an air squat.


In case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.


Beginner option:

12 rounds for time, starting with 1 and adding an exercise each round:

1 
inchworm

2 candlestick rocks

3 burpees

4 push-ups from the knees

5 walking lunges

6 air squats

7 sit-ups

8 jumping squats

9 jumping lunges

10 broad jumps

11 
dumbbell shoulder presses

12 
box step-ups


‚ôÄ 
10-lb dumbbell, 12-inch box

‚ôÇ 
15-lb dumbbell, 20-inch box


Perform the workout like the "12 Days of Christmas" song. In Round 1, perform 1 inchworm. In Round 2, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 3, perform 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding a new exercise each round.


Coaching cues:

As you lower yourself to the bottom of an air squat, think about grabbing the floor with your toes and ‚Äúscrewing‚Äù your feet into the ground. This will keep your knees tracking your toes and your entire foot in contact with the ground.

20:11 - Rx but with more of a curtsy to guard L knee on pistols.
Also wasn‚Äôt sure of the odd number of lunges so did a total of 10 walking lunges and 18 jumping lunges each round.
Lots of legs!

RX'd except sub'd inverted push-ups for the handstand push-ups.
The sequence of jumping squats, jumping lunges, and broad jumps really compounded the fatigue on the quads!

If such a workout comes up, and I did not know it, and I had to write a class shedule, how can one estimate a time for the workout? 230 reps? 4sec/reps? +50%? 20-25min? 
I did not time mine, close to 30min, scaled wallwalks after rd 3 to inchworms, candlestick rocks hand assisted, scaled burpees with no jump from beginn for no reason, scaled hspu to pike push ups and failed pistols after 3 reps, then did 12 narrow stance squats.
