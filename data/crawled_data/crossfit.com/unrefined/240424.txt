4 
wall walks

chest-to-bar pull-ups

single-dumbbell overhead walking lunges

Scaling:

Today’s workout is a high-skill triplet. Choose scaling options that challenge you but allow you to maintain a consistent pace for the entire workout. Adjust movements, load, and volume if needed to complete each round in less than 3 minutes. Switch hands as needed on the overhead dumbbell lunges; otherwise, these reps should be unbroken. As you begin to fatigue, manage your rest and minimize the amount of time spent looking at the pull-up bar and/or lying on the ground.
