21-15-9 ~ (11:00)
BurpeeDeadLifts 35lbs 
BoxJumps 24in 
Did this one after a slow lower/pull lift session. Rested too much to avoid redline. 
Think this one was programmed a little too cute. DeadLift burpees interfered with each other's stimulus. BoxJumps were true and tough per usual. 
BurpeeDeadLifts is a movement I will skip next time.

Box jumps overs fully over (no stop at top) and a little jump with each DL burpee (saw a few different ways to do it, so I went that way with it).
Almost missed the burpee part when I read it. Glad I didn‚Äôt miss that spicy slice of hell.

As rx‚Äôd, 6:24.
Unbroken, full send.¬† Wish I could jump like I used to ‚Äì box jumps were very fatiguing, worse than burpee deadlifts.¬† Was able to jump out of the burpee, but in rounds 2 and 3, I had to step into the burpee for most reps.¬† Lats were too fried.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead.
Hero workout: Hotshots 19
Six rounds for time of:
30 Squats
19 Power Cleans 75# (Rx is 135#)
7 Strict Pull-ups
Run 400 meters
31:38
On June 30, 2013, 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighting team tragically lost their lives while fighting a fire in Yarnell, Arizona.
Just tried to keep moving.  Used 75# for PC in order to have large if not unbroken sets, and to reduce the load on the elbows.  First round was completely unbroken, not so much for the others.  Legs were already sore going into this - tomorrow will be interesting.

Good morning, I'm new to this. I'm trying to get an idea about how regular crossfiter approach the daily workouts. I've been exercising my whole life. I played competitive soccer since a kid and then I was in the military combat arms. We did crossfit in the army but we just made up some really brutal workouts like 100 pullups, 200 push-ups, 300 situps, with quarter mile to mile long runs between. It was brutal. But today's workout is super short. I will probably do a 10 minute warmup with squats, pushups, mountain climbers, and then do a 10 minute cool down with curls, triceps, and a few short quarter runs. Is this approach normal or is it too much? Thanks.

Welcome!  Check out past WODs. Monday was a heavy max day on a complex movement. Tuesday and Wednesday were longer, one monostructural and one muscular stamina-centric. This was (supposed to be) a quickie. Each hit different time and glycogen pathways, which is central to CF‚Äôs methodology.   Constantly varied functional movements at high intensity across broad time domains keeps it interesting, tough, and keeps us coming back for more.

What's up Shawn! Welcome on! There's a great CrossFit Journal from the archives called 
A Better Warm-up
 that I think would be a good read for you. It sounds like you're on the right track. I find it usually good to keep in mind that the short workouts are usually designed to feel at least as bad - if not worse - than longer ones. This one is no exception. So if you find yourself doing them and not feeling very tired afterwards, you might have missed the intention on that day. No big deal! Just remember it for next time and make adjustments.

Today, I ended up doing a 30 minute warmup
Warmup: superset 3x20 squats/push-ups, 3x50 mountain climbers, superset 20 pound curls 3x15 supset elbow to knee crunches 12 reps and calf raises 20 reps, tricep extension 15 x 20 and single calf raises. 
Then I did the wod in about 12.5 minutes (i forgot to look at my watch) and it was a lot harder then I expected. Overall, it was great workout. Hopefully I paced it correctly so I won't be sore tomorrow.

I used 40 pound dumbells because I don't want to be sore. If I can't work out the tight muscles the next day it's too hard for me. Good luck to all you younger more courageous people.

Basically same. I have done sports my whole life, plus Army (AIRBORNE ALL THE WAY!). I have always strength trained. I started CrossFit like 3 weeks ago and underestimated how important endurance was! I have always had muscle strength and thought I had endurance, but boy was I wrong! These WODs are legit! I was RXd which is great, but it took me 9:32. I was thinking I would get like 6min. Once again I understand estimated! CrossFit is becoming more and more fun every day!

Looks like that is burpee box jump overs followed by deadlifts. 
This one is DB burpee DLs. I think you do the burpee and DL the dumbbell. Do that 21 times then do box jump overs 21 times. If you did it how you described then it would just just be 45 straight reps of those 2 exercises.

Do you do 21 reps of dumbbell burpee DL, 21 box jump overs, 15 DBburpeeDL, etc? And on the burpee do you jump or no?

The video is similar, but not for this workout.
Hold two DB's while doing a burpee.

Welcome! 
Might I add to what others have said. You want to try and maintain the same pace throughout and or speed up (if possible) as the reps decrease.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
The thing on my mind when looking at this workout is almost like that joke, "you know somebody's a CrossFitter when..." When I first started CrossFit there were a few clear markers: kipping pull-ups, consecutive Olympic lifts, anything on the rings, any kind of handstand variation; to us new people, those were on some "Man, when am I ever going to use this," type stuff. But after enough doses, it became clear that every single fitness program for every single demographic would have a major vulnerability if it didn't include kipping pull-ups, handstands, high-rep Oly lifts, and ring dips. Those are what I understand to be Phase 2 Adaptations: new kids won't get them right away but just about everyone will with enough consistency. And what's my evidence behind that? Look at how much high school weight rooms have been remodeled in recent years; lifting platforms with rings hanging, pull-up bars, and open space.
So in 2024 how do you know someone's a CrossFitter? Welp, dumbbell burpee deadlifts would be a pretty dead give away for me. Any variations of box jump overs and smiling on rowing machines would be right there as well. Deadlifts are crazy helpful for all sports and life needs, same goes with burpees. Putting them together? Either your midline habits are so robust that you need to challenge them through changing orientation and extra range of motion, or you're a CrossFitter thinking about getting better at CrossFit.
I really feel like these notes are speaking to the veterans more than the new people, so if we're talking about Mel Man, Coast-to-Coast, Link's Awakening, One More, Money Mike, and the rest of the suspects on here I've given nicknames for, they've done enough workouts where dumbbell burpee deadlifts would really challenge both their deadlift and burpee positions in ways they aren't used to; it's a great curveball and a gimmick that can give a mental break from the usual core foundational movements. Same with box jump overs: how does your jumping mechanics look when you're focused on not biting it on the box? As for new people... are you looking for Phase 3 Adaptations or Phase 2? Or Phase 1? It's really really rare to be too good at plain old deadlifts and burpees and box jumps. Purely speculation, but this workout has the taste of being made by someone who participates in CrossFit competitions more often than using CrossFit to help compete in something outside of the weight room.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Am I consistent enough and experienced enough to do these specialty movements?
Would I be better off doing regular deadlifts and burpees and box jumps?
What part of jumping do I want to challenge on the box: elasticity or changing orientation?
What is my back going to look like on deadlifts coming up from a burpee?
Will I notice that my elbows have to be in on dumbbell burpees and change all by burpees to look like that?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
30-sec deadlift hold (empty bar, probably a 15 will do)
10 box jumps (step-down)
10 push-ups

Dude, you hit the nail on the head again in my opinion.  Your notes and today's WOD movements remind me of how much more challenging the DB burpee DLs in the Hero WOD Tumilson was for me when I did it months ago.  In case you don't remember that workout is: 8 RFT of 200m run and 11 DB Burpee DLs (60# DBs).  Adding those DBs to the mix was uncomfortable in an awesome way you wouldn't expect until you do it.

Right you are! The added DL element was a fun challenge and it inevitably shifted the fulcrum and made me think a little bit more on the way up.

Globo wod: sub for box jump overs are bench jump overs, jump over another object of similar height, or 30/36" broad jumps back and forth.  Dumbbell burpee deadlifts as Rxed.
