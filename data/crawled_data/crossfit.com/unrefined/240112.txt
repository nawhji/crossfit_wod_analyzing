Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:


8 rounds for time:


8/6
 bike calories

 burpees

M/33/5'7"/216lbs
Intermediate 5Rds (1:30,0:30rest)
10 EchoCals
Burpees (10,10,6,6,6)
Did this one as a conditioning piece after a long slow lift. Tried to program built in rest. EchoBike always blows me up fast, and so do burpees. Finished cals in about :30 and then gave 1:00 for burpees. After 2 rounds I redlined with the rest. Took the 5 round exit. Will have to redo this one as a beginner. Lame fail.

As rx‚Äôd, 16:57.
This was about as fun as it looks on paper.¬† Goal today was to balance pushing the pace versus redlining, which I think was successful.¬† Started pushing a bit harder toward the
end, and did start feeling it.

Really dumb question but what does 10/8 bike calories mean? Is it my choice of 10 or 8 calories or is there some kind of difficulty rating of 10 or 8 and the other is calories? Thanks y‚Äôall

Today‚Äôs workout, 10 rounds of

10 burpees 
18:04
Generally 16-17 strokes/10 cals
Worked on not dragging my knees on the floor during the burpees, so as to have a clean push up off the floor. For what it‚Äôs worth, feet always shoot back before my hands touch the floor. Multiple molecules of air under my feet in each jump.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead:
Murph
46:58 (Rx except for wearing the 20# plate carrier for only half of the reps)
It has been a hot minute since the last time I did a Murph weighted.  What a difference that extra 20# makes.

14:53 (Echo bike)
This workout crushed me. Struggled to keep the wattage above 300. Clearly a weakness.

Still‚Ä¶fast. You must‚Äôve exploded out of the push-up phase of the burpees!

Rxd (10x10x10) at the Y. No echo, used spin bike. 
12:07
followed Chris S accountability scale and kept rest to under 5seconds between stations otherwise just kept moving. I think doing this on an Echo would have been harder as my arms got a chance to rest while cycling for calories.

Nice work! Yeah, a piece of paper might have been able to slide under my feet for the later burpee jumps.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Scaling calories for girls on the bike? Am I reading that right? Also, not sure how calories turn out on the bike (or rower for that matter) so notes may be off.
MAIN DECISION
Pace until the end to ensure a good score or risk going out fast for your best score?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
						x
MEDIUM
HEAVY
STAMINA SCALE
For time:
100 burpees
100 calories on the bike
NOT JUST THROWAWAY CONDITIONING SCALE
Put a sock or hat between your feet on the burpees, jump high with arms straight and thumbs pointed back, read up on Pose method for a bike
HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE SCALE
Anything more than 5 seconds rest at any point (top or bottom of burpee, transition from stations) means your workout is done
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Maybe split up the burpee into a push-up and box jump if you want to make some progress on different movements. Otherwise as listed should be pretty good.
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 8?

Globo wod: most globos have some sort of stationary bike, such as a Schwinn or a spin bike, if they don't have an Assault or echo bike.  Go ahead and use that today if you can.  Subs for bike are 13/10 calories row or 20 jumping squats if equipmentisnt available.  Burpees as rxed.
