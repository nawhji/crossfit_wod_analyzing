Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a mix of high-skill gymnastics and grunt work. You have to pay the toll of the shuttle runs in order to play with the handstand push-ups. Scale the number of shuttle runs to finish in 1 minute or less. The most challenging variation of the handstand push-up is up first. Challenge yourself, but not so much that you spend a lot of time resting. There is more benefit in scaling the handstand push-up and continuously moving than in trying to do too much and twiddling your thumbs.


Intermediate option:

As many reps as possible in 
6 minutes
 of:

3 
strict
 handstand push-ups

5 shuttle runs

As rx‚Äôd, 4 rounds + 3 SR (38) / 4 rounds + 1 SR (51) / 3 rounds + 3 HSPU (45).  134 total reps.
Runs got easier as I went along, HSPUs got harder.¬† I don‚Äôt really kip them, so the set of 9 was tough ‚Äì had to break those 6-3.¬† Did the cartwheel thing to get into wall-facing HS, and then rolled out.¬† Only smacked my foot into the door hard once.

Due to injuries I began this WOD using 2 25lb DBs as my scale for the HSPU and did shuttle runs RX. After the round with 15 reps I still had over 3 minutes of rest time so I shifted gears and restarted the WOD using a 95lb barbell, starting with the barbell overhead using a snatch grip and lowering the bar to the top of my head and then back up. 
I made it all the way to the round with 27 HSPU but could only do 24 press reps.

Scaled/subbed Intermediate version
6 min AMREP
3 Shoulder Press (2x55# DBs)
5 Shuttle Run (Rx distance)
5rds + 3 SP = 18 reps
2 min rest
6 min AMREP
6 Push press (2x55# DBs)
5 Shuttle runs
5rds + 6 = 36 reps = 54 total reps
No version of HSPU were happening (still can't load the elbows like that), so opted for the scale/subs I did.  Did 3 rounds of 20sec HS hold, 200m run and 75ft farmer carry with 2x55# DBs afterward.

As intermediate, except used one abmat for part with strict HSPU
6 rounds/5 rounds + 3 kipping HSPU (flat surface for these)
all HSPU (both variations) unbroken every round 
tested strict HSPU to abmat but could only do singles so used abmat to preserve stimulus

Rehabbng scapular nerve:
2x wall walks + 5x shuttles = 3 rounds + 2 wall walks + 3 shuttles
6x pike push-ups + 5x shuttles = 4 rounds
9x 20-lb DB shoulder press + 5x shuttles = 4 rounds + 9 DBSPs + 1 shuttle
DBSPs revealed relative health -- left way too easy, right barely got there

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I probably need to reformat these notes a bit, seeing as I haven't been doing the main site for a minute.
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM						x
HEAVY
FORMAT/MOVEMENT QUESTIONS
How much integrity do I want to treat the shuttle sprints with? Are they recovery between HSPU or are they meant to make the HSPU more tiring?
How strict are "strict" HSPU?
Will I allow my toes to help creep me up the wall on the wall-facing ones?
Do I have all three options of HSPU available to me while fatigued?
Do I need a straight-line run instead of shuttle to work on technique?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
Run 200 meters
1-minute handstand practice
5 slow, strict push-ups
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 6?

Globo wod: If your gym doesn't allow you to do HSPU sub the scaled dumbbells version but increase weight as follows.  Rx do dumbbell strict shoulder presses at 75% bodyweight total.  Intermediate do dumbbell strict shoulder presses at 60% bodyweight total. Scaled follow scaled guidelines.  If possible follow up with handstand holds and handstand walks. If shuttle runs are not an option in your globo sub 200m treadmill sprints with a high incline.
