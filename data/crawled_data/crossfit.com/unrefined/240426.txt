Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead: we had a choice, Manion or Chelsea
I did Chelsea + 1
30 min EMOM
6 Pull-ups
11 Push-ups
16 Squats
Completed all rounds.
Compare to 230327: Rx Chelsea, completed all rounds
I opted not to do Manion today because I will be doing it on 240429 regardless of what is programmed. Doing Manion twice less than a week apart is a bit much for the legs.  Did 1 round of 250m row and 10 DL at 135# afterwards as part of cool down.

It's been more than a minute since I've hit 300 w/straight bar DL- so pretty happy-it felt great.

Globo wod:  If a rower isn't readily available sub either a 200/250m run, 15/18 calories assault or echo bike, or 13 burpees.  If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline. Dumbbells sub for the deadlifts are dumbbell deadlifts 60/85lb Dumbbells (Intermediate 50/70).
