Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a shorter effort and twist on the benchmark workout Amanda. This variation highlights the gymnastics element of the workout and challenges your skill set. Don‚Äôt let the lower volume fool you ‚Äî this workout packs a punch. The load of the barbell should allow you to complete the set of 9 in 1:30 or less.


If you have strict muscle-ups, but you are limited by the volume, consider reducing the reps to 5-4-3 or 3-2-1. If you do not yet have a strict ring muscle-up, perform low-ring muscle-up transitions. You can increase or decrease the difficulty of these by moving your feet forward or backward of the rings.


Intermediate option:


3-2-1
 reps for time of:

Strict ring muscle-ups

9-7-5

‚ôÄ 65 lb


‚ôÇ 95 lb


Beginner option:

Hang power snatch + overhead squat

Did this one as a continuous quick quality lift after a lite session of moderately heavy squats. PullUps and dips were a vigorous set, but not redline or to failure, maybe had 2 reps left in tank. 
SquatSnatch focused on quality. Felt good about the technique after doing heavy SquatCleans last week. Pulls felt good and balance and mobility in the hole was excellent.
Good stinger session.

Ankle is still freshly sprained. Jumping was affected in PullUps but not too bad with snatch. Best possible type of workout on a bad ankle. 
Feel like I've done this workout before.

The squat snatch was difficult for me and I seemed to land my snatch with wide feet. Any suggestions on get a more stable foundation and keeping feet shoulder width apart?

Rxish
Low ceiling mod. Rings at the height that arms were fully extended, while starting from my knees without kipping (but maybe some wiggling). Squat snatches as Rx but several failed reps killed my time.
8:41
Son(16):
Rings at the same height but with feet on the ground, jumping some on takeoff. SS at 95lbs
6:49
Compare to 220407 
7:12 (Seated ring muscle ups with a kip kick)
Son(14):
Feet on ground for low ring muscle ups (feet used for dip takeoff). SS at 75lbs

Strict Dips
Squat Snatch 95#
7:29
MUs weren't going to be a thing.  Wasn't sure what my joints were going to handle today so stopped at 95# on the SS, and left out CTB pull-ups. Pull-ups and dips were done 1-for-1 style.  SS were nice and smooth much to my dismay seeing I haven't done any in a while.

No rings at the Y (not sure if I can do a strict muscle up anyway!). Went strict chest to bar and strict deep dips on bars. Scaled weight to 115lbs. 
11:28. 
spent 90s trying to hit the last 2 reps of the round of 9. Finally got them but just got stuck. Glad I was able to finish the other rounds. 135lbs would have been a mess.

Bar MUs (w/kip)
75 lb Squat Snatch
Tried doing strict bar MUs, couldn‚Äôt get good momentum to get over the bar, switched to kipping. I‚Äôm interested to see how I could do with rings.
Snatch will never be heavy for me. I‚Äôve learned to cope üòÜ

Globo wod : If you don't have rings today: if your pullup bar allows for it do strict bar muscleups (or progressions). If you are subbing pullups and dips sub 3 strict chest to bar pullups and 3 weighted bar dips or strict TRX dips per muscleup rep.  Dumbbells sub 2 to 1 dumbbell squat snatches 35/50lb dumbbell, alternating.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Nothing to rant about.
MAIN DECISION
How "strict" am I going to make my strict muscle-ups?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM
							x
HEAVY
STRENGTH SCALE
For quality:
45 strict pull-ups
45 strict dips
45 overhead squat as close to rx as possible
*split up reps however
POWER SCALE
As is, but rest as needed between stations
STAMINA SCALE
Mush everything together into one round, do whichever movement you're better at second
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 7?
