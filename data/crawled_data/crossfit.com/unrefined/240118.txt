"The distinction we make between resistance training and metabolic training
(‚Äòcardio‚Äô) may seem clear to us, but nature honors no such distinction."

As Kanye said, "Never be the same / never be another". 
Just a hint, by the way, if you search his name in the workout archive section you'll see quotes like this scattered through tons of workouts from 2001 - 2005. My favorite goes something along the lines of, "for those complaining about gaining weight and muscle, get up to 30 pull-ups in a row and you'll gain 5 pounds of lats alone." Something along those lines.
