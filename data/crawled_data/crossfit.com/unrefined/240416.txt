Scaling:

Today’s workout is meant to be a heavy sprint. Regardless of the other two movements, push the pace on the bike and don’t game it. Exiting the bike a little wobbly is what makes this workout fun. The 5 front squats should be tough and feel heavy; however, you should be able to clean the barbell to start the reps and perform each set unbroken.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:


35
 double-unders

-calorie Echo bike

5 front squats


♀ 125 lb


♂ 185 lb


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:

75

Tuesday i did a Hike (Brand trail, Glendale, CA):

 TIME : 8:24
scaled: Beginner.
75-SU's
13-cal assault bike
5-front squats (cleaned) # 115 
good weight choice from floor! could've done #135 but didn't want to compromise form, also reason 
SU's were the choice  because of amount of reps, working on going higher but at about 40-DU's things get ugly. 
after that bike, the legs are  like jello pudding.

75 singles under (1st rd I did 80, not sure why)
21 Burpees
5 front squat from ground @100
My form felt better, so I believe I could have pushed more weight, but didn't want to stop. I'm learning technique right now, so I'll increase each time.

3 Rounds 
150 Single Unders

185lbs x5  (with belt| I need to strengthen the core muscles in my back) 
time : 11:28 
I'm currently working to lose about 12-15lbs by the beginning of June. I’ve always lifted, ran, and occasionally did some cross fit workouts. But starting today I’m going to set a goal to participate in all the daily workouts over the course of the next month and a half. I’ll be adding in body weight movements most days cause I want to improve my controls over my own body weight. I’ll also be adding a day or 2 of some long distance running/sprints.

The intermediate weight was the perfect option with the 4th and 5th rep each round being very challenging.

Modified/Scaled
3RFT
35 DU
21 cal Hammer Strength Echo/Assault style bike
5 FS (155#, hands crossed, pulled from rack)
11:50
DUs are a weakness but wanted to get them in without losing some stimulus in excessive tripping.  Wanted to keep some weight in the FS, but need to cross my hands with bar on shoulders to go heavier than about 115# due to physical inability to get into a real front rack. Also, my knees are sore as hell from yesterday. Fun WOD though!

I agree. Good discussion and good take! 
I think both points of view boil down to what is (truly) useful to the individual and having the discipline to make yourself do it. And a fun grind can be useful too!

I'd do Jumping Jacks, Sprints and Pistol Squats if I didn't have any equipment. If you have a little bit, Ist go with Steven's modifications.

Globo wod: If you are using an assault bike add 3 calories to each round, C2 rower add 7 to each round.  An equal amount of Burpees over bar/dumbbell are also an acceptable sub for the echo bike. Dumbbell sub dumbbell front squats 60/80lb dumbbells.
