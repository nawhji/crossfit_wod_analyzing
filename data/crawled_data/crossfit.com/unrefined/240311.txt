Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout should be quick, but the beefed-up variation of the single-leg squat may cause a few speed wobbles. Use a single dumbbell or kettlebell to load the single-leg squats (athletes may choose how to hold the weight). The single-leg squats should be challenging, however, each set should take no more than 1 minute to complete. Scale the load to hit this stimulus. Each set of knees-to-elbows should be completed in 1 minute or less. Scale the height of the knees to hit the intended stimulus.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time:

12 
knees-to-armpits

12 alternating 
single-leg squats


Beginner option:

5 rounds for time:

12 
hanging knee raises

12 
alternating reverse lunges

Subbed pullups for knees to elbows. Knees to elbows are harder than strict pullups! Subbed box step ups for pistols. Pistols are lame!
Did this one as a conditioning piece after a slow lift day. Good pull-up pump and did a good 100 step-ups.

Pistols - 20lbs DB, down to 13" box (sit)

Sprained 2 fingers Sunday. Did this today (Tuesday) with above mods to keep pressure off the fingers.
Pistols with 1 DB are tough.

Threw out the timer (i.e. shot clock - thanks Chris), but still did 5 rounds
12 KTE
12 Pistol progressions
Progressions were a mix of toenail squats, single-leg to bench (with 10# plate under heel and without), and assisted pistols with 10#/5#/no plate under heel. Did a few deep box step ups with a 10# plate as well just focusing on depth. Quality was the mantra for today.
Chris S. - thank you, I need to be reminded sometimes that it‚Äôs ok to get a workout in where I am just focusing on mobility and skills without feeling like a pansy for not smashing it in. CF does truly expose your weaknesses and punish you for them in a way to make you better.

4 rounds, Rx reps/weight. Used a 35lb DB in a goblet position for pistols. Did not do 5th round.
Knees to Elbow were easy. Decided to stop because the pistols fell apart on round 4. Never done them weighted.

I didn‚Äôt exactly sit onto the box, but knowing it‚Äôs there and will keep you from crashing to the floor is reassuring, even if it makes the exercise easier than it would otherwise be.

First round of pistols did 2 reps with 35#, 10 reps with 20#.
No weight for the final four rounds.
Just needed to work on pistols. Simply do not have the requisite strength to add weight to them at this point. 
KTE were unbroken throughout.

Globo wod: If a pullup bar isn't available sub v-ups. Scale pistols as necessary, unweighted,  pistols to a box, band assist pistols, or deep step ups.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Since the high school season is going right now and those players have been with their schools for the winter, these last few months of AAU basketball have been spent with our grade school and middle school. Yesterday at a tournament I came to what, for me, at least, was an interesting analogy: it seems like most coaches and parents are treating youth basketball like there's a shot clock. What I mean by that is there seems to be a sense of urgency surrounding 3rd - 8th grade basketball that might make sense if the kids were juniors in high school (which, as luck would have it, is the first year we play with a shot clock). Things like jumping from team to team, frustration if we don't get the concept of help defense rotations, insistence on practicing shooting form (the dumbest of them all), and a belief that being a reserve player scrapping for mop-up minutes will set them back permanently are seen and felt through the entire gym. I also get to see how difficult it is for the 17u kids to adjust to playing with a shot clock, and most times the offense just resorts to pick 
and roll
 for me and everyone else just stand there while defenses switch everything. And that's with kids one year away from college: really dope 6th graders still blow wide open lay-ups! Anyway, sitting in all that mess this weekend made me think of CrossFit, and how much we take for granted the "for time" part of each prescription. Coach Glassman gave us a shot clock back in 2001 with "Fast & Heavy" dumbbell thrusters and running and since then that sense of urgency has led to an adaptation that has, literally, changed lives. The tricky part comes from the fact that CrossFit will always ALWAYS find what we suck at and punish us for it. I'm 34 years old, but I'm a 7th grader when it comes to pistols; I'm best not having a shot clock for them. Knees-to-elbows? Yeah, they're fine... but are they still gonna be fine after holding up my leg in an L-sit during the pistol sets? Every workout is designed for players who are fast enough to break a press, smart enough to up an offense, strong enough to get to the right spots, calm enough to make the right reads, make the right reads, and confident enough to get a good look all within a 30-second shot clock. Keeping impeccable squat form on pistols in a warmup is difficult but doable; doing it in the heat of a 5-round sprint takes a very strong, flexible squatter with excellent habits built in. Just be real with yourself if that is you today.
SCALING QUESTIONS
More shaded towards getting better at CrossFit or more shaded towards getting better at stamina?
How would you scale this if you wanted to go all-in on making progress on stamina?
How would you scale this if you want to go all-in on the specific movements (get better at CrossFit) and don't have them like that yet?

Man, all that ranting about pick-and-roll offense distracted me from the other point I was trying to make. On a grand scale, we have to understand if our fitness has a shot clock. Do you need your pistols to improve 
today
? Do you need to get full ROM on your knees to elbows 
right now
? How important is it that you get a heavy breathing intense dose 
for this workout
? If I'm coaching a kid I only see once a week, or maybe a soccer girl about to to play overseas, or a really really fat dude, that the answer to those questions might be yes. If I am coaching someone that is in 6-7 days a week for the last two years or a 6th grader, the answer might be no. The veterans who these notes are directed towards have the luxury of... well... being veterans! Your foundation is so well established that, with few exceptions, there is not really a sense of urgency for you to get every possible thing you can out of a workout. Just get a dose! Someone coming in once-a-week needs as much of the 10 general skills as they can possibly pack into one session; you guys might take a workout to focus just on flexibility, or maybe strength, or maybe balance (a sneaky thing knees to elbows can develop). Don't be afraid to experiment during a workout to shade it towards something you need to practice. If you don't get the dose you were hoping for: no big deal! Most of the time there's no shot clock on our fitness.

Chris, I got your point, and a shot click is a good analogy. My weakness is normally mental, not physical; the heart and body generally can give more than the mind will push for. 
Regards training for CF or life/fitness, that seems to be based on perspective. KTE hasve little to do with life, but it‚Äôs a potent hit to the core, both front and back. And nobody will ever do a pistol outside the gym/box, but the strength + balance it takes will, I hope, translate to life, especially as one ages and balance/coordination wane.

From a local perspective the knees to elbows is pulling from the hips; it's incredibly functional if you can look at it as a sit-up. Same with the pistol - if you can do a pistol you have full hip and ankle range of motion, which means you are well towards Fit on the Sickness - Wellness - Fitness continuum.

Chris--re: dumbest of them all--shooting form.  I need clarification from you:) Do you mean they need it more? or parents think they don't?
As a 6-8 grade PE/Health teacher, my kids can dribble like old school Curly from the Globetrotters, which is fun to watch, but I just let them shoot or a lay up and I'll just wait for the rebound--not all the time, but A LOT.
I can also attest to the dribble down as fast as you can and let the 3 pointer fly and see what happens.....

Mike, shooting form meaning elbow in, ball high, flick the wrist, off hand passively guiding, etc. Anything to do with the arms or torso. Everyone chucks at that age. The most important thing to get right is the footwork: right-left when going to the left; left-right when going to the right; left-right when spotting up (for right-handed players, opposite for lefties). The upper-body part of shooting doesn't really get finalized for most players I see until they're in college, so don't worry about it too much. Footwork on lay-ups is a must though! You're spot-on!
You teach in Plymouth right?
