That being said, if you can complete at least 10 chest-to-bar pull-ups in a minute and 3 wall walks per minute, you should consider performing this workout as prescribed and keeping it under 20 minutes.

As rx'd, 16:39.
Went pretty good.¬† Did sets of 3 throughout for the pull-ups; it‚Äôs the only way I can get through this many.¬† And no tears, which is nice ‚Äì had the grips ready just in case.¬† Wall walks, just tried not to rest too long at the bottom.

1h back & shoulder session followed up with CrossFit Warm-Up, then when I was ready hopped into the WOD. 20 minute time cap and scaling to my abilities.
14 assisted chest-to-bar pull-ups
6 scaled wall walks
12 assisted chest-to-bar pull-ups
5 scaled wall walks
10 assisted chest-to-bar pull-ups
4 scaled wall walks
8 assisted chest-to-bar pull-ups
3 scaled wall walks
Came pretty close to finishing it, definitely worked me out. First time trying wall walks, not easy at 6‚Äô5‚Äù & 250lbs!

Rx reps, but scaled to inverted/parallel ring rows and inchworm+push-ups
10:20
Tried a couple of WW and box walk-outs (thanks Favo) and pull-ups in the warm-up, but the left wrist and right elbow still weren't quite there for this loading and volume combo.  Still a good pump.  Did some more inverted work plus assault bike time after.

Wall walks hard on strained leg muscle, so
14-12-10-8-6-4-2
pull-ups
inchworms to a push-up and back, from a standing position
14:29
Inchworms too easy, but a decent workout.

Knew I wouldn't be fast with this, but chose to keep reps at Rx & scale moves, so I'd get the practice I need:
Rx rep scheme
CTB - banded
1st 6 wall walks, then walk outs off 24 in box in pike (on toes) for the rest
17:07
Went to 25 mins with WW to HS holds against wall & extra CTB practice afterward
