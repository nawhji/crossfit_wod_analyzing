Workout of the Day

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:
5 front squats

10 ring dips


‚ôÄ 125 lb

‚ôÇ 185 lb


Post rounds and reps to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a weightlifting and gymnastics couplet. Because of the lower repetitions in each set, expect to perform at least 5 rounds. The barbell should come from the ground and the loading should be moderately heavy. Choose a load that enables you to perform all 5 reps unbroken every time you pick up the barbell. For the ring dips, if you can complete 10 dips in 3 sets or less, you should perform the prescribed movement.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

5 front squats

5 ring dips


‚ôÄ 
105
 lb

‚ôÇ 
155
 lb


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

5 front squats


5 foot-assisted
 ring dips


‚ôÄ 
35
 lb

‚ôÇ 
45
 lb


Coaching cues:

If you are kipping the ring dips, as you descend to the bottom of the dip, try to keep your legs somewhat straight. When you reach the bottom, drive your knees up toward your chest and press down into the rings. This knee drive will help you kip your dips more efficiently.

Interesting to read! This workout is a 10-minute AMRAP (As Many Rounds and Reps As Possible) of front squats and ring dips. Aim to maintain good form, especially on the front squats with 125 lb for women and 185 lb for men. Push hard, but pace yourself to keep moving efficiently through each round.

Rx‚Äôd from the floor: 6 rds + 11 reps
Better than I thought I‚Äôd do. Pulling the barbell off the floor added some complexity and interrupted the flow a bit (in a good way?).

Rx rep scheme:
FS -landmine style* 100#
TRX dips (toe assisted)
* wanted to take these from the ground, but go heavier than I can clean consistently & with good form, thus the LM version of FS; still not an easy move for me!
6 rounds + 5 FS
