Post times to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. Its nickname is “the three bars of death.” The earlier rounds of this workout are a bit of a grind. Go unbroken where you can and manage your reps when you need to catch your breath. For example, singles on the squat cleans are a great way to manage your heart rate and prepare yourself for the next round. This effort contains a high volume of weightlifting at a moderate load. Reduce the loads and/or eliminate some of the early rounds to decrease the total volume. If you are able, use a spotter when performing the bench presses. This is purely a safety consideration. If you are unable to find a spotter, do not push to failure and break before you think you need to.


Intermediate option:

10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 reps for time of:


1 ¼
-bodyweight deadlifts


¾
-bodyweight bench presses


½
-bodyweight cleans


Beginner option:


8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
 reps for time of:


¾
-bodyweight deadlifts


½
-bodyweight bench presses


⅓
-bodyweight cleans


Coaching cues:

In the bench press, be sure to set yourself up so your feet can have full contact with the floor. This will allow you to drive through your heels and use your lower half.

These are some solid strength benchmarks! Hitting 1 ½-bodyweight deadlifts, bodyweight bench presses, and ¾-bodyweight squat cleans shows impressive balance in strength and technique across multiple movements.

Don't think I've done this one before - 
215lb DL
60lb dumbbells for the bench press
35lb dumbbells for the squat cleans
(Used dumbbells as that many bench and SC with a bar would cause a lot of shoulder pain)
Approx - 32:15
Ouch!

195# BW, loaded bars based on 200# BW because I’m lazy
DL @ 300#
BP @ 200# 
Squat cleans @ 150#
29:18
As per, squats did me in again. But proud they actually felt not completely devastating. Been back squatting everyday and I’m feeling the improvements.

Globo WOD: as this requires so much equipment I will provide subs for each movement.  1. Deadlifts: heavy dumbbell deadlifts (double reps if using lighter dumbbells), kb deadlifts or heavy tire flips, or strict pullups.  Try to keep this movement as Rxed if possible.  2. Bench press: ring /TRX/ weighted bar dips, push press  (if no bench is available), dumbbell bench press at 75% bodyweight total, or HSPU.  3. Cleans: dumbbell cleans at  50% bodyweight total, sandbag cleans.  Try to set this up the best based on your Globo or garage setup. Each person's gym and equipment situation will be different so do the best you can here.  If you are doing this in a class doing it as a team wod may be the appropriate solution. 
Bodyweight sub: 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 reps strict pullups, strict ring dips or HSPU, and pistols (alternating,  double reps) or Bulgarian split squats each leg.

23:50, much scaled in Goodlettsville CG. 
Ised 195 on DL by strapping 40lb DB’s to end of bar for additional weight. Deep pushups on perfect push up handles with feet up on first step for BP. Only used 115 for PC. Done in the dark at 1700. Still a burner, but getting older sucks…

Rx(35, 229lbs)
DL@345lbs, Bench@225lbs, Squat Clean@175lbs
Son(17, 195lbs)
Almost Rx
DL@275(first 3 rounds @295lbs), Bench@195lbs, Squat Cleans@135lbs(first 4 rounds @145lbs)
We shared the same 3 bars and started at the same time with me on DL, him on SCs. I changed most of the weights for us.
51:36
221030
Performed at 335, 225 & 170lbs
Dropped the bench weight so many times, resetting by myself, that I didn't get a good time recording. I think most of those cleans were of the power variety.
Son(15 & 170lbs)
221030
225, 115(dropped from 125lbs after first set), 85lbs

Rx’d with one bar and a lot off adding/removing weight for said bar between sets: 40:27, 170lbs body weight.
221030:  32:31, same one-bar situation and same body weight.
Felt good, so I’m not sure why it’s 8 minutes slower. Maybe I miscounted rounds last time. Oh well.

Compare to 221030: same but 95# PC, 44:10
Opted to do PC vice SC and up the weight a little in an effort to save some wear on the knees. Last time only had 2 BB and not enough plates to more efficiently load. This time had 3 BB but tried moderating HR a little too much.  Still, Linda is a crusher.

Linda "with a finishing kick"
10-9-8-7-6-5-10
Intermediate scale:  200# DL, 115# BP, 80# squat cleans
2 bars:  deads and SC on one bar, BP with other bar
All lifts unbroken, so probably a tad light on all 3 movements
30:59
10/30/2022: 21:57 (205/115/35# DB power cleans, 2 bars, rx rep scheme)
1/5/2020: 41:30 (225/135/115#, alternating power and squat cleans, 1 bar, "finishing kick" rep scheme)
5/26/2018:  41:43 (225/145/115#, alternating power and squat cleans, 1 bar, rx rep scheme)

Tough question, Patrick. To me, Girl workout movements and rep schemes should be accessible to everyone, which eliminates a few, like Mary, Amanda, and Diane.  So the best/worst for me are Kelly, Eva, and Linda. I love Cindy and Chelsea b/c I can really crank thru the sets, and Fran and Elizabeth are the most misery in the shortest amount of time. 
Plus I love Kelly b/c she used to work out with us on main site, smoking almost all of us while being older, and way shorter and lighter than most everyone posting. 
But everyone has their own list, based on their strengths/weaknesses and pain thresholds!

Rx rep scheme:
Modified for no rack/spot & ability limits to:
DL - 130# BB
BP -  60# (2x30# DB)
SC - 40# (2x20#DB)
21:47
Not breaking any speed/weight records here. Focus was on form/full squat. No "compare to"-1st Linda, so nowhere to go but up (in weight) & down (in time) from this.

2 movements with DBs adds its own spice, too. Not that Linda needs it…

Thanks, guys. I only have that one men's bar & not enough big plates, but honestly, even with all the plates & bars & racks, I could not have moved that amount of weight with these lifts  (maybe the DL). Linda easily kicked my butt this go 'round!

Agree on the awesome time with one bar! If the welding doesn't come through, you can go NASCAR pit crew.

Thanks @ Jonathan Elmore. The “girls”…done at 50% or 100%…are meant to be humbling. Linda is amongst the most humbling.

the programming in the last few weeks was amazing!
47:24 rx + 5 lbs 
using EU weights my BW is slightly below 80kg at 78 (79kg with shoes)
So I just did:
120kg DL (265)
80 kg Bench (175)
60 kg Squat Clean (132)
*ass to grass squat cleans!
Damn, this was much harder than I expected. Linda is maybe not the most intense but in my mind definitely the hardest classic girl benchmark Wod. (I haven't done Eva yet though)
