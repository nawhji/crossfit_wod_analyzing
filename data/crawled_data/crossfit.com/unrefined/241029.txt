Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a grind. Expect this effort to fall in the moderate-to-longer time domain with most around the 20-minute mark. The goal is to move at a pace on the rower that allows you to hang on to the dumbbells for all 50 reps of the step-ups. The dumbbell weight should be relatively light and begin to tax your grip around the 30- to 40-rep range. If you are having to put the dumbbells down multiple times in each set, the dumbbells are too heavy. If you want to make this workout ‚Äúspicier,‚Äù pick up the pace on the rower.


Intermediate option:

4 rounds for time of:

500-meter row

50 dumbbell box step-ups


‚ôÄ 
10
-lb dumbbells and 20-inch box

‚ôÇ 
15
-lb dumbbells and 24-inch box


Beginner option:


3
 rounds for time of:


300
-meter row


30 box step-ups


‚ôÄ 20-inch box

‚ôÇ 24-inch box


Coaching cues:

To speed up cycle time on the box step-ups, whatever foot steps down last is the foot you should step-up with first on the next rep.

Do both feet need to be on top of box for rep or just hip and knee extension?

*Started at 24", couldn't keep pace. Also lost count!!! Did I only do 40 on last round???
(Doesn't matter. Saturday I climbed Old Rag in Shenandoah National Park: 9 miles RT loop, ~2500' elevation, of which ~1.5 mile / 800' is all boulder scramble to summit. That's my kind of Chad 1000x training.)

Intermediate and subbed 25 cal Assault bike for run.
27:29
Went out way too hot on the first assault bike set and too much breathing in between exercises. Unbroken for all BSUs. In hindsight I could have done it with 20s if not Rx but I decided on 15s after reading the scaling notes knowing that I would likely be able to hold on for every rep.

As Rx‚Äôd M/43 26:10 - rarely have a seen the rower as an easy option. This was as much about mentally keeping going as it was physically. Brutal.
