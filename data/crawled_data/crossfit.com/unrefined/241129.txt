Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a classic chipper-style effort. Some may recognize it as the ‚ÄúDirty Thirty‚Äù with an added row to begin the workout. The goal is to make it as far through this workout as possible within the allotted time. Some may even finish the double-unders and get an opportunity to get back on the rower. However, most should aim to make it to the wall-ball shots and get as many reps as possible before time runs out. To hit this stimulus, the row should take no more than 6 minutes to complete. Every other movement after should be kept to 1:30 or less.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 15 minutes of:


50/75
-calorie row

30 box jumps

30 jumping pull-ups

30 kettlebell swings

30 lunges

30 knees-to-
chests

30 push presses

30 hip extensions

30 wall-ball shots

30 burpees

30 double-unders

Coaching cues:

In the dip of the push press, your torso should be vertical with your shoulders and hips stacked over your ankles. As you dip, think about sliding your knees forward slightly as your shoulders and hips drop straight down over your ankles.

Scaled/subbed the following: 75 cal row, 20‚Äù box, DB for KB, knees to chest, good mornings with empty BB (for hip extensions), 60 singles for DUs.
230 reps (made it through 20 reps of WBS, so 305 if you count the cals as reps).
Finished remaining reps about 5 minutes later. Less than stellar output today. Just got really gassed by the time I got around to the WBS. Yesterday‚Äôs culinary overindulgence likely didn‚Äôt help. Caution informed some scaling lack of gear forced the GMs and a DB vice a KB.

Yeah, I wasn't counting the row cals as reps at first; brain was still catching up afterward, I guess! Nice job on this!

Rx except 60 single unders
Got to 12 single unders @ 15 minutes (282 reps) then finished the last 18 @ 15:33
THIS is a GREAT workout: portable, with a few mods, total body, calorie torch, endurance/cardio, quick...all the things.
 Will be revisiting! Thanks HQ!
