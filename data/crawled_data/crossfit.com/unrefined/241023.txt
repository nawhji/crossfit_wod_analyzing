Scaling:

This classic benchmark contains a high volume of a light weightlifting movement. Choose a load that allows you to hang on for large sets. Consider strategic breaks as a way to keep yourself moving and avoid longer periods of hook-gripping your shorts. Remember, one more rep is one rep closer to finishing the workout. Be sure to look back at your previous score to help you better understand your strategy for today’s effort.

Coaching cues:

Oftentimes in this workout, it's the shoulders and arms that cause you to take more breaks. Immediately after releasing the ball, consider bringing your arms back down toward your shoulders. Take a quick breath, and get ready for the ball to return. Repeating this across larger sets can delay shoulder fatigue.
