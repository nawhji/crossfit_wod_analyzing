As rx'd, 21:15.
Nearly unbroken OHS.  One break in second round of 9, where I got soft in the bottom and lost the weight.  Did all squat snatches to open each round, except the last round of 5.  Paced the rows, went a little harder in the back half.  About 1:55 pace.  Tough one.

Did WOD on 4/6/24
starting over after 6 yrs of absence, doing wods 5 days a week, it's my therapy, I do wish this had a time cap. i feel really slow after seeing the times put up BUT, its a great motivator for me.  I also wish that there were warm ups posted with the WODS( hint, hint) to the admins, i love the site and the layout for different levels, skills and capabilities. welp enough of my sucking up to the site ( lol)
scaled :  TIME: 37:25
row cals
5-6-7-8-9-10-9-8-7-6-5
Overhead squats- #75
10-12-14-16-18-20-18-16-14-12-10
wow, i was pumped thinking i could do the intermediate, nope, the #75 gut punched me. i probably shouldve went to #65 but refused to go lower, i broke the overhead squats up from first  round of 14 until finished. ( sets of5-7). the row was my so called rest. My time,  I'm feeling bad about but, i am determined to get better and hopefully back to or close to where i was before the hiatus.

That's not a bad time.  Good work!  by the way, I think you switched the rep scheme for rower vs. overhead.  You did way more overheads than prescribed.

Every joint was feeling tender and no gas in the tank today, so reduced the weight a lot and took my sweet time in the transitions. All reps unbroken, and left the C2 on drag 6.

I did the rows at a slow-moderate pace on my machine that may read heavy. OH squats are a weakness for me but today went pretty smoothly and unbroken.

Clock killer: long rests before last 4 OHS sets. Should have done 55~60 lbs?
Rehab note: strained back on 240403 SDHPs (rd.2, DNF !!!), rested Thu&Fri. Feels a lot better today, but still weak on OHS.

Does anyone have a good shoulder flexibility routine that worked well for improving flexibility for overhead movements? I struggle to pin the bar behind my ears making OHS nearly impossible for me to execute with weight. I lose my balance as the bar rolls forward at the bottom of the squat.
