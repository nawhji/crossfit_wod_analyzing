Scaling:

Today’s triplet has a short to moderate time domain, depending on your ability to manage your strict gymnastics strength and stamina. Perform this workout as prescribed if you can complete at least 3 unbroken strict chest-to-bar pull-ups and 5-7 hand-release push-ups without deviation of your midline (aka “snaking” your push-ups). The loading of the lunges in this workout should be light enough that you can perform each round unbroken. Don’t stop moving on the lunges, and challenge yourself to perform one more pull-up or push-up before breaking on each round.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:

10 
strict chin-over-bar pull-ups

20 hand-release push-ups

30 dumbbell front-rack walking lunges


♀ 15 lb


♂ 25 lb


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:

10 
ring rows


15
 hand-release push-ups 
(from the knees)

20 
unweighted
 walking lunges

PullUps 10, 10,10
Release PushUps 20,20,20
DBLunges 25lbs 20,20,20
Broke up each set. PullUps were good and went to failure. Releases were good and went to failure. Lunges were scaled down and went to failure. Arms were dead after. Hips felt alright, manageable, but still causing awareness.
Little disappointed that every time I see lunges I scale down. Sadly I think this was the correct call for me today. Want to get more lunges volume to be confident. Front lunges, back lunges, walking lunges, curtsy lunges, etc. Just need to do more lunges.

Scaled to strict regular pull-ups. 7:57. 
Unbroken pull-ups, unbroken push-ups until last round (struggling).  Lunges were unbroken in round 1, broke halfway through in rounds 2 and 3.  Just a quick break to set the bells down.

Another late go at the WOD due to travel.
Scaled to 3 Strict CTB Pull-ups and 7 Strict pull-ups, otherwise Rx.
11:36
Spicy! Scaled the pull-ups as I couldn't get more than 3 CTB without starting to kip a little.  The knees are not going to be happy with me in the morning.

Scaled to
3 rounds for time of:
10 strict pull-ups
20 hand-release push-ups
30 Kb (16kg) front-rack walking lunges
Total time 12:20
First round i tried to do strict chest-to-bar pull-ups, but only did 5 reps and noticed i didn't have the capacity to do 30 reps, then scaled to strict pull-ups. 
Felt my shoulders burning at the end of the workout.

15 ring dips
30 walking lunges, 15# DBs
10:25
Dips vice hand release PU b/c the plank position is hard on the tweaked back. Light lunges for the same reason.  I read the workout as a single DB, but used 2 since that seemed to be the consensus.

I am 2 weeks post-op from breast augmentation surgery and only have access to an apartment gym at the moment.
Modified to
3 Rounds For Time
10 Bent Over Rows (35lb DBs)
20 Knee hand release push ups
30 Front Rack Walking Lunges (20lb DBs)
Completed rows unbroken or in 2 sets of 5
Completed push ups in 10-5-5 sets
Completed lunges unbroken or 2 sets of 15
Time 12:15 
This was definitely a tester for me for starting back into push ups. Felt a little funny but no pain. I kept them at a slow pace but overall I am super excited that I was able to do them on my knees. I’ll be back to RX movements before ya know it :)

Mike, I used 2, but the singular use of DB vice plural DBs in the workout description made me think it was supposed to be one.

14:45 rx (2x35lb dumbbells) 
For avoiding the "banana" I only touch the floor with my chest and feet/hands. 
Pushups are perhaps the most cheated on movement ever! It's great that we do hand-release Pushups, because you see so many people claim they can do 100 unbroken Pushups but then only go half the way down - it's ridiculous! 
It's even worse when it comes to One-Arm Pushups (in my calisthenics phase I worked up to do 50 in 10min (alternating)) but you see so many people who twist their shoulders when doing them - for full RoM the shoulders have to be kept parallel to the floor at all times.

That is unlear however under "scaling" it says you should be able to do the reps unbroken. So if you can do 30 lunges with 35lbs in each hand without pausing then go for it!
