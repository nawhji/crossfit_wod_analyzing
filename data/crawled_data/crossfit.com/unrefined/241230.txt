Stimulus and Strategy:

Today’s workout is a benchmark. If you have completed this benchmark previously, look back to your last attempt and use the information to help you attack the row. Push for a PR today. If this is your first time, ease into your first 500 meters and try to increase your pace the further you get into the effort. Most athletes can perform this effort as prescribed and record a benchmark time in the 
CrossFit Games app
.


Scaling:

Reduce the total distance of the effort.


In case of injury or limitation, perform a 1,600-meter run or 3,500/5,000-meter Echo bike.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:


On an 8-minute clock:


Row meters for distance


Coaching cues:

In your first 500 meters, hold 1-3 seconds faster than your target pace overall. In the middle 1,000 meters, pull back to your target pace. In the final 500 meters, find out what’s left in the tank.
