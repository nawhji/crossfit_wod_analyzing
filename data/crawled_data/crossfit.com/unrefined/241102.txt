Workout of the Day
61
Every 6 minutes for 5 sets, complete:

800-meter run


Compare to similar 
240617.


Post fastest and slowest times to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is an endurance- and stamina-based effort. The goal is to finish each interval under the 6-minute clock and have a little time to rest. If you do not have at least 1 minute to rest before the next interval, reduce the distance. Expect this effort to be more about finding consistency versus an all-out effort.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.


Beginner option:

Every 6 minutes for 
4
 sets, complete:


400
-meter run


Coaching cues:

As you run, "grab the ground" with your feet and slide it back behind you with each step. Focusing on this action, when performed consistently, can increase the force applied to the ground and in turn the speed of your stride.

Rxd at the Y on 11/3. Treadmill runs, incline at 1.0. 
3:23-3:40
kind of felt like a cheat when you can set the pace as I doubt I would have pushed that hard some of the rounds!

Better times overall, notwithstanding Rd 1. Good display of the importance of warming up (I started cold). Also may have to do with the slightly different resting format this time.

Rx rounds but modified to:
.95 mile road bike ride (2 laps in neighborhood)
5 Front squats (135#)
10 Ring dips
4:17 fastest 
4:33 slowest
All rides were between 3:20 and 3:35. FS was from the rack with bar on shoulders and hands crossed - wanted to preserve the wrists and elbows for the RD. Intended to use 155# but the knees weren‚Äôt there for it today - same reason for subbing the ride. Spending 20 out of 24 hours in aircraft and terminals takes a toll these days. 
Compare to 240617: Rx 3:31, 3:32, 3:31, 3:35, 3:33

I run regularly & Saturdays are usually my long, outside, hilly ruck days. Didn't want to forfeit either, so used the 5 - 800m runs as Rxd, but in my 20# plate carrier, as a "warm-up" to the ruck.
Fastest: 3:33/Slowest: 3:53
Total ruck: @ 2-3 hours
Nap in sun: pending.

something was wrong with my stopwatch/phone so unfortunately couldn't measure the third and fourth run but they might be in the same range as the others. Rest time might also have been off by 10-20sec, I can't be sure.
went at it at a moderate pace from the beginning to keep the times as close as possible to each other, seems to have worked well.

Globo wod: if you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline. Subs are 1000m rows or 50/60 calorie assault/echo bike sprints.
