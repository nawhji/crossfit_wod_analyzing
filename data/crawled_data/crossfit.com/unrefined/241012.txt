Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a grind. The effort is all about completing one more rep and one more step forward. A single round should be completed in 7 minutes or less. Scale the number of push-ups per round if you can not perform 12-14 reps per minute. The loading of the barbell should be light. Try to hang on for as long as possible without putting it down. Keep the completion of each lunge to 3 sets or less.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:


30
 push-ups

50-meter front-rack walking lunge

Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:

 push-ups 
from the knees

-meter walking lunge


Coaching cues:

Everything goes down and comes up together in the push-up. Squeeze your stomach, your quads, and your glutes as you press off the floor.


Resources:

The Front-Rack Lunge

36:00 @95 lbs, 50x 1m Lungestep 
Did the first 50 Pushups unbroken, with perfect form in exactly 2min (in accordance with Glassman's old article https://brokenscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07_03_Pushups.pdf)
Push-ups 2:00-4:30-5:30
Lunges 5:30-9:00-9:30
I'm not particularly week in the legs with a 335lbs Backsquat but somehow this Wod was very Lunge heavy for me (33% Pushups+ 67% Lunges at the scaled weight)
