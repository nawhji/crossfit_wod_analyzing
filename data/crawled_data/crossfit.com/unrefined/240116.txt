Run 0.5Miles
Did 3 miles today. Half EASY and half hard. Plank and boat felt longer than a minute, boat felt in lower abs. All unbroken except for last boat hold. Good tempo run day and recovery was quick after the runs. Feel heavy in weight but running output/turnover is still great.

completed 1/17 at the Y immediately following 240117. HS against wall. Parallel bar L-sits. Row 800m (discovered the screen was non functional when I went to run on the air runner, should have tested it!). 
23:04. 
compare to 21:07 using bow sits and outdoor runs.

Intermediate - HH back to wall, L-Sits alternated between hanging and on push-up bars
27:48
Compare to 221026: 25:18, similar execution.
I purposefully broke the holds more with more rests to mitigate elbow issues.  Cold and wet outside so that made the runs suck more.

Between ice and not wanting to deal with opening/closing garage door every round, opted for rowing sub. There I was, all set to do 1000m when I see Steven astutely noting the sub is but 800m. No Steven, thank 
you.
20:29
1 minute handstand, against wall, took one foot off when I remembered
1 minute tuck hold, tried to straighten out legs best I could
800 m row

Nice job Jim!  I made myself embrace the cold, wet suck outside cause rowing makes L-Sits that much worse.

Globo wod: intermediates find a wall, pole, or even a Smith machine for the handstand holds.  L sits can be done on rings, dip bars, between 2 boxes, on parallette bars, on dumbbell handles, or hanging from a pullup bar.  Subs for runs are 800m row or 55 calories assault or echo bike.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Nothing to rant about
FORMAT/MOVEMENT QUESTIONS
Do I want to treat this like a traditional "overall time" workout or treat it like separate strength and conditioning pieces?
How strict will you be on your L-sits?
Would you be better off losing intensity and allow for lots of mess-ups on freestanding handstand, or would you be better off keeping intensity and going against the wall?
Do you really need to practice your 75% intensity 800m speed that you use in most workouts or do you need to work on something faster?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
											x
MEDIUM
HEAVY
STAMINA SCALE
Mush everything together into one round, push the 1.5 mile run hard
STRENGTH SCALE
Split up the L-sits and handstands any way you want each round to make them the best quality possible. Then use the run as a bit of a rest.
I'M NOT FEELING IT TODAY BUT WANT TO MAINTAIN SOME DIGNITY SCALE
Go for quality on the handstands and L-sits, use the first two 800m runs as rests for the gymnastics stuff, then sprint the last 800, or whatever you got
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
5 rounds of:
2:00 handstand practice
2:00 L-sit practice
400m run
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 7
