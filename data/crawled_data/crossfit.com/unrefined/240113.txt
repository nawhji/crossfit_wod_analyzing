Scaling:

Complete both 800-meter runs in 5 minutes or less. However, don't crush yourself on the first run because you need to come back to the kettlebell and get right to work. The loading of the kettlebell should allow for 15-plus reps at a time. As for the lunges, keep moving and try to go unbroken. Get moving on your final run. Your legs will feel a little like Jell-O, but once you start moving, they‚Äôll remember what to do.

Had a heavy lift day yesterday and didn't want to do lunges. Just did more KB swings. Done a workout similar to this a while back with stamina scale of just 100+ heavy KB swings followed by a (1-1.5?) mile run. Back blew up as expected. Runs were at a hard pace but did not redline. Just wanted to get in a solid run today.
 Feel like running is missing from my workouts lately, and that I'm out of running shape. Still not too bad, my engine saved my legs. Just checked the box as getting a running workout in after yesterday's heavy lift.

Subbed / scaled with
Row 1000-500-1000 m
1 pood KB
2x 0.5 pood dumbbell lunges (rack)
19:36
Broke down on the lunges - had to pause at each turn-around (at 19, 28, and 50 lunges), then broke down on the final row: stopped for a sip of water, then caught a crab with wet hands, just a mess.

53/m/210/70"
I misread the WOD description and did 60 more KB swings instead of walking lunges. To punish myself for not paying attention to detail, I did the 60 lunges as a "cash out" after the WOD.
Cannot run so did the 800 and 400m on the rower with damper set to 5.
GREAT WOD!
