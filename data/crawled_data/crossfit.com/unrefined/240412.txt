Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark, originally created for an MMA fighter to simulate the feeling of a 3-round match. Although we are not fighting in this workout, it does pack a punch. Push to keep moving for as much of each minute as possible. Capitalize on movements you excel at and pace yourself on your weaker movements. Most athletes should be able to stick with the interval pattern. Beginners should reduce the loading and height of the box. Intermediate athletes can complete this workout as prescribed.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:

3 rounds for max reps of:

1 minute of wall-ball shots

1 minute of sumo deadlift high pulls

1 minute of box jumps

1 minute of push presses

1 minute of rowing (calories)

Rest 1 minute

With the benefit of seeing tomorrow's burpee WOD, I went with a SDHP variation instead of burpees for the row.

Did this beast on 240413
Rx 309 (PR)
[111, 101, 97: didn't log individual movement reps, just kept counting through the round]
Compare to:
230904: Rx 293
220415: 297 (subbed tuck jumps for BJ - no box)
Finally broke the 300 barrier (recorded), but man this required quite a bit of warmup after yesterday's beat down, aka our Bulletproof workout.

Subs
dumbbell thrusters (2 x 13lb DBs) = wall-balls
55lb bar for SDHPs & push presses
123 + 109 + 103 = 335 reps
230904 with 
15lb
 DBs, 122 + 96 + 84 = 302. Way better today with 13lb DBs.

Back from travel and did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead...but man it was nearly FGB spicy.
Team Workout (3 teams of 3 today) 
Part 1
Murph team style ‚Äì team must accumulate the run distances and the reps (runs must be with 20# plate carrier, but reps can be slick).
¬†
Part 2
100 Box Step-ups (24‚Äù)
100 Wall Ball Shots (14#, 10‚Äô)
100 Burpees
Part 3
.62 mile casualty carry (1 member Fireman carries another, members can switch out carrying as necessary)
Third member runs with 20# PC and rifle
Curve Ball (Each team can throw once to each of the other teams to slow them down)
Gunshot wound aid (fake wound naturally) - stabilize casualty and apply tourniquet correctly (then remove the tourniquet of course)
20 Buddy Squat with the casualty (i.e. Back squat the casualty)
My team finished 2nd at 31:50.  Lot's of fun, tiring, and will no doubt make FGB even more interesting when I do it tomorrow.

rxd. At the Y. BJs onto platform, short bar with 25s. Med ball WBs. 
324 reps. (Pr)
2023 - missed 
2022 - 285
box jumps and rows were probably the lowest numbers each round, but this time I just kept counting instead of recording each rounds movements reps. Just tried to keep moving.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I am a firm believer that, as a veteran CrossFitter, it is okay to "test-out" of some workouts: get 30+ rounds of Cindy and go ahead and do Mary, run a 16-minute 5k and do something else when that workout comes up. That's not to say you're better than what the workout has to offer, but rather the margins for improvement are so small that a lot of things outside your control might have to be in place for a pr to happen, and it might be a better use of time to emphasize another weakness. Of that, I'm confident I'm not being soft. But in my own opinion, I think everyone gets to have one single workout they are allowed to waive the white flag for; they've posted a good enough score, gave a good enough effort, and attempted it enough times to the point where they will admit that no matter what kind of pr comes, it's not worth the dose that it dishes back. I've done Fight Gone Bad probably 7 or 8 times in my CrossFit career - all of them between 2006 and 2009. The last time I did it was a 3 rep pr and is, to this date, the most agony and exhaustion I've ever felt in my life. I will never do Fight Gone Bad again. I am being soft. It wins.
I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE BUT WANT TO GET A DOSE SCALE
1 round all-out. This, alone, is probably a 7
I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE AND WANT TO STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THAT FEEL AS POSSIBLE SCALE
As is, but modify the movements to emphasize power and strength: Highest toss possible on wallball, maybe heavy sdhp, high box jump, strict press or hspu, and maybe short sprints for row
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Turn off the timer and practice each movement 5 times. You decide the dose.
I FIGURE A 17 MINUTE DEATH IS QUICKER THAN MOST PEOPLE GET, SO MIGHT AS WELL GO TO THAT PLACE SCALE
God bless. In all seriousness though, if you really are going for a pr, just constantly ask yourself if it's your brain of your muscles getting more tired; if it's your muscles then no more than a 3-second rest at any point in time; if it's your brain then just know resting means you'd rather be soft than get a pr.
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 10

Yeah buddy!  I don't know if I have a specific workout yet that I say 'not today' or 'no way' for routinely, but that half-marathon row programmed several years ago may be it for me.  Great rant and scaling questions as usual!

What you said about ‚Äútest(ing) out‚Äù and margins of error make a lot of sense. My problem when I get to those WODs I do well  (or pretty good) on is that temptation to see if I can push it even further with the prescribed WOD. You‚Äôre right, though‚Ä¶. I could try using my time more wisely üòÜ. As always, I appreciate the comments that make me wax introspective.

Coast to Coast, you're a bad dude though. Just because you can test out doesn't mean you have to. In fact, I really respect, for example, you going to beat your 32 rounds of Cindy (if I recall correctly) by a few reps and missing more than hitting a massive pr on a workout you have only done once.

Globo wod:  sub for wallballs are dumbbell thrusters 15/20lb dumbbells.  Dumbbell sub for push presses and SDHP are 20/30lb dumbbells. Sub for calories row today are burpees. For box jumps you can jump on a bench or platform,  or build a box with those aerobic step things.
