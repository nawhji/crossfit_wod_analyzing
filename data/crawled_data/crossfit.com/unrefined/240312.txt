Scaling:

Today we are going heavy relative to each athlete‚Äôs capacity. Even though most athletes can perform this workout as prescribed, the challenge is the technical complexity of the movement. Only add load if your lifts are mechanically sound. Each athlete, regardless of experience, should focus on technique before load.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd

Today was all about the snatch and ohs. Heavy Triple @ 125lbs is close to 135lbs 1RM. Got a good dose of some ohs as well. 
Need to do Randy hero workout and alternate with some heavy midrep snatches.

For load:
Power snatch
7x3 Had to keep weight low then drop weight to maintain mechanics. L Shoulder also not 100% since mtb crash couple years ago. Probably breaking up scar tissue.

Yeah Jim, I didn't have any more to give in terms of load (while maintaining solid technique), but I had plenty left to continue to work.  I briefly contemplated doing Randy, but ultimately decided to do just the little bit extra and call it good to preserve the elbows and wrists.  Good job still getting in some work!

Barely hit that 125, so I'm going to call it a new PR since I don't remember what my 3 rep PR is.  Did 3 sets of a triplet afterward: 2/2/2 reps of PS/HSS/SS at 75# without setting the bar down.

95/100/105/115/120-
These were all drop from top, immediately back on the bar.
95/95 these were to practice cycling the bar.
m/54/175
compare to
100/100/110/115 pr/105/110
I'm guessing these were cycled, but not sure from my notes:(
Almost done with a book called Do Hard Things by Steve Magness.
Highly recommend for everyone--

Globo wod: If you are using iron plates today use a weight that you can bring down under control and do sets across the 3s at a heavy but  controllable load. Dumbbells sub dumbbell power snatches 7x3 left then 3 right, increasing in weight.  If you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets.
