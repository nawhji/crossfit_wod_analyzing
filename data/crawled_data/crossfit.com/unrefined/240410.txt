Today's workout is in honor of Randy Simmons, 51, a 27-year LAPD veteran and SWAT team member who was killed Feb. 7, 2008, in the line of duty. He is survived by his wife, Lisa; son, Matthew; and daughter, Gabrielle.


Scaling:

Today’s Hero workout is a sprint. The loading should feel light (very light for some). Reduce the load so you can perform multiple reps unbroken and complete all the reps in less than 8 minutes. Athletes who are less familiar with Olympic lifting should take time to drill the mechanics of the snatch and reduce the load and reps.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d


Beginner option:

For time:


50
 power snatches


♀ 15-35 lb


♂ 25-45 lb
