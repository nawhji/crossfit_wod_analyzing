Workout of the Day

1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 reps for time of:

Sumo deadlift high pulls

Ring dips


‚ôÄ 75-lb barbell

‚ôÇ 115-lb barbell


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a classic pull and push movement combination. In theory, you should be able to go back and forth between movements with minimal interference. Tread lightly in the first few rounds as they will go by very quickly. However, the later rounds are a different story. The loading of the barbell should be light to moderate and allow you to perform most of your sets unbroken. As for the ring dips, if you are going to do these as prescribed, we recommend you be able to complete consistent sets of 3 or more unbroken reps. To reduce the difficulty of the ring dips, consider jumping dips or foot-assisted dips.


Intermediate option:

1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 reps for time of:

Sumo deadlift high pulls


Jumping
 ring dips


‚ôÄ 
55

‚ôÇ

Beginner option:

 reps for time of:

-lb barbell

‚ôÇ 
45
-lb barbell


Coaching cues:

Set the rings up high enough so your legs can be somewhat straight as you descend to the bottom of the dip. Once you get to the bottom, bring your knees up toward your chest and push the rings into your pockets. The longer legs allow for a more effective kip.

Performed CrossFit Warm-Up before hopping into today‚Äôs WOD, scaled it to my abilities as I have nowhere near enough stability to do any variation of ring dips.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 reps for time of:
Sumo deadlift high pulls (75lbs)
Assisted parallel bar dips
Time: 10m36
Tough workout today. Sumo‚Äôs felt pretty easy, but those dips were tough. Took a bit of time before the WOD to try holding the top position of ring dips after speaking with a trainer at the gym who‚Äôs proficient in them. Gonna start working on ring dips more once bodyweight dips on parallel bars become easy.

Slight kip in RDs. All unbroken but like Jim, too much time spent breathing. Still, did better than anticipated. Did some OHS, pull-up, and wall walk work after.
