Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a mental and physical test. On paper, this workout creates an ominous thought of too much time on the rower ‚Äî and that's exactly what‚Äôs intended. Adjust the load of the dumbbell so you can perform at least 10 unbroken snatches. Consider holding the dumbbell in the farmers-carry position, the front rack, or on the shoulder. Ultimately, the choice is yours, but the goal is to perform 50 lunges unbroken. Don‚Äôt look at the clock ‚Äî just jump on the rower, push the pace, and get to work. Have fun!

KB Alternating Snatch 40lbs
KB singleFarmerCarry Lunge 40lbs 
Was not feeling like carrying a 50lb db across college gym into box room. KB Snatches are awkward and bang your forearm and stress the elbow. Scaled down to 40lbs for safety of bad technique. Just wanted some exposure to the movements. Lunges are tough muscularly. Told myself to trust my fitness and push muscle failure since engine would not fail me in this heavy KB workout.
Warmed up the long slow session with 1K row and finished with 1K as well. Said meh to the max cals at end. 
Slightly sick and plan on doing fran with burpees tomorrow.

With a 40# DB, 816m/53 cals on a Matrix rower. 
First time ever in a Planet Fitness. Weird. Huge facility, not a single barbell not in a Smith machine. And all sorts of cues to not work out very hard.

Single DB the whole workout? Lunges just a single DB? 50 unbroken with 150lbs of DBs is some beast shit.
