This one felt good. Might've had 200-205, but was satisfied with a heavy 195lb single. Smooth.

Need to work more on my front squat form.  The position feels really awkward and wrecks my wrists.  Found some banded mobility drills that will hopefully help with that for next time.

Globo wod: If your globo has bumper plates go to town today.  If not, you have a few options.  First is to build to a heavy but controllable single and repeat 5 times.  Another option is to split the clean and the jerk down to components,  do the cleans, then do the jerks in a rack using safeties if necessary. Same concept, sets across at a heavy but controllable single.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell clean and jerk to a heavy single.  If you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets.
