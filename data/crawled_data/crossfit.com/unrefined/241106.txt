21-15-9 reps for time of:

Deadlifts

Strict pull-ups


‚ôÄ 155 lb

‚ôÇ 225 lb


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a gymnastics and weightlifting couplet. Most should finish this effort in 10 minutes or less. For those proficient with these movements, it will be a sprint. However, if you can perform at least 7 reps with the prescribed deadlift weight and consistent sets of 5 unbroken strict pull-ups, then you should hit this workout as written. It might not be a sprint, but it will be an opportunity to build capacity in these two movements. If you cannot hit those targets, reduce the loading of the barbell and the difficulty of the strict pull-up.


Intermediate option:

For time:

21-15-9 reps

Deadlifts


12-9-6
 reps

Strict pull-ups


‚ôÄ 
125
 lb

‚ôÇ 
185
 lb


Beginner option:

15-12-9 reps for time of:

Deadlifts

Ring rows


‚ôÄ 
55
 lb

‚ôÇ 
75
 lb


Coaching cues:

In the deadlift, delay the knee bend on the return of the barbell. After you stand up the load, unlock your knees and then focus on sending your hips back while keeping your chest up. You should feel tension in your glutes and hamstrings ‚Äî this is good. Once the bar passes the knees, you can bend the knees and return the barbell to the floor.

As rx'd, 10:31. ¬†Felt sluggish.¬† Did after heavy deadlifts.  Broke deads 15-6 / 10-5 / 6-3.  Broke pull-ups 7-6-5-3, then lots of breaks after.  Down to singles in round of 15.

Only one break in the DLs with the 21 & 9 unbroken. Spent all my time on the PUs. Should have upped the weight, I doubt my time would have changed.

As mentioned in yesterday's post, did one of our Friday bulletproof-like workouts today instead
For time:
249m run
2 rounds of
17 pull-ups
75 squats
2 rounds of
17 burpees
75 crunches
Then another 249m run
17:35
I decided to do a little extra afterwards of some of today's WOD: 45 Deadlift at 185# and finished the remaining pull-ups to equal 45 reps. Didn't time that but I did the DLs in 15s unbroken, pull-ups in 5-4-2. Tomorrow's bulletproof-like workout will be squad based.
