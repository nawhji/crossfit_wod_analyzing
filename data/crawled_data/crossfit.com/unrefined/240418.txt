Scaling:

Welcome to the first workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! Today's workout is a gut check. How bad do you want to push for another rep? None of the movements should be overly difficult or too heavy, so there is no reason to stop moving. The barbell should feel on the lighter side of moderate. You should be able to perform touch-and-go reps, however, under fatigue, you may choose to perform fast singles to keep moving.


Choose a pace on the rower that is fast relative to your capacity but still allows you to get right to work on the dumbbell box step-ups. Your goal on the dumbbell box step-ups is to hold onto the dumbbells until the minute is up. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.


Remember, there is no rest between movements, so accumulate as many reps as possible of each movement but leave time to transition to the next. Plan to stop with 5-10 seconds left in the minute to transition for all of the movements except the dumbbell box step-ups. During the minute of rest, try to control your breathing by taking deep breaths in through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. If you are not signed up for the Quarterfinals, choose loads that challenge your ability but allow you to keep moving and hit the workout stimulus.
