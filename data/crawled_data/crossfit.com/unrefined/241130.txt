Scaling:

Today’s workout is a combination of lifting and static holds. You will also notice the pull-up bar hang is after the hang power cleans (pulling and grip intensive). Then the handstand hold is after the push jerks (pressing intensive). Because of this design, a moderately loaded barbell will begin to feel significantly heavier and the holds will test your stamina with the related movement functions. Complete the handstand holds against a wall. Scale the loading and duration of the holds so a single round takes no more than 5 minutes to complete.

Coaching cues:

During the handstand hold, resist gravity by pressing your body away from the floor. As you press into the floor, squeeze your glutes, tuck your ribs down toward your hips, and bring your ears in line with your biceps with your chin neutral.
