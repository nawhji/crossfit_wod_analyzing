Putting “The Hopper” and Your Fitness to the Test


CrossFit emphasizes developing broad, general fitness, avoiding specialization to handle any challenge life presents. While athletes like triathletes excel in specific sports, such specialization often leads to weaknesses in other areas. CrossFit's "hopper model" promotes balanced fitness, preparing athletes to perform well across a variety of tasks, while testing fitness outside the gym fosters a sense of accomplishment and adheres to CrossFit's "Fitness in 100 Words," which encourages athletes to learn and try new sports regularly.
