Compare to

Scaling:

Today’s workout is a take on a classic CrossFit Hero workout Nate. Typically, you are trying to complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes. Some might say the clock saves you. However, today the goal is to get through 10 rounds as quickly as possible. The kettlebell loading should be moderate and allow you to go unbroken through all of your sets. Athletes performing this workout as prescribed should aim to complete a round in 2 minutes or less. Look back to the last time we performed Nate to help you choose appropriate options for today’s effort.

Coaching cues:

For the muscle-up, as you begin to press/pull the rings to your sternum, bring your hips up toward the sky. Meeting the rings with your body parallel to the ground will make the transition much easier as you begin to fatigue.

As rx'd, 15:50.
Had to do extended warm-up on muscle-ups to feel comfortable in the bottom position of the ring dip.  But felt good in the workout.  Kept just under redline to make sure I didn’t
fail any MUs.  I failed the last rep (twice), so went a little too hard at the end.  My best Nate is 13 rounds (in 20 min), so this was fairly comparable.

No rings but had dip bars. Went with the DB shoulder press as it was easier on the wrists and elbows.  Stayed with the 24kg KB after warmup - didn't like how the core was feeling this morning.

Globo wod: a doosy, and one that is difficult to do in a Globo given equipment issues and movements that may not be allowed in a Globo gym. But here we go.  Muscleups: If you have rings you're set. Sub 2 bar muscleups and 2 TRX or weighted dips, or 4 chest to bar pullups and 4 TRX/ weighted bar dips per round if rings aren't available. HSPU sub is heavy dumbbell push press with the dumbbells adding up to 60-75% bodyweight. Piked Handstand pushups off a box or bench can be subbed or used as a scale as well. For kettlebell swings sub dumbbell swings 70/50lbs if kettlebells are not available.  Time cap 25 minutes, so scale in a way that allows the 10 rounds within the tc.
