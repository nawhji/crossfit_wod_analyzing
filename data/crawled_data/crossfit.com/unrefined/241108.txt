Workout of the Day
98
3 rounds for time of:

35 GHD sit-ups

70 double-unders

400-meter run


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a bit of a midline burner. Expect the GHD sit-ups to challenge your posture for the double-unders and the run. This will force you to put extra emphasis on maintaining better posture and a rigid midline throughout the workout. With that said, if you are not accustomed to the GHD, you should consider scaling the reps and range of motion. If you struggle with double-unders, do not spend more than 2 minutes working on this movement. Instead, spend the 2 minutes accumulating attempts and then move on to the run after time is up.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:


25
 GHD sit-ups 
to parallel


40
 double-unders

400-meter run


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:


20 sit-ups


40 single
-unders


200
-meter run


Coaching cues:

As your midline gets fatigued, you might begin to “slouch” with your posture on your double-unders. This makes it difficult to breathe and recover. Focus on keeping a forward gaze and being as upright as possible when you are performing double-unders.

1h back & shoulder session followed up with CrossFit Warm-Up, then when I was ready hopped into the WOD scaled to my abilities.
3 rounds for time of:
20 butterfly sit-ups
2 min. double-under work
400m run (did on treadmill and it shut off during round 1, then again on round 2 so I hopped on the rower, then it was fine for round 3)
Time: 18m18
Thought there were only 20 sit-ups for the intermediate option, would’ve done the 25 if I hadn’t misread lol.

As previously posted, we did a unit run today: around 2 miles in formation with everyone doing 6 pull-ups after.  It was a good time and a welcome reduction in work after 4 days straight training with 2 of them being bulletproof style.
Happy belated birthday Navy! Happy early birthday Marine Corps!

Globo wod: GHD subs are situps on a medocine ball, bosu ball or sitting perpendicular on a bench with your feet under heavy dumbbells, then performing situps touching the ground behind you, weighted abmat situps, or 2 to 1 abmat situps.   Remember, be careful when performing GHD situps, scale or substitute if you don't do these frequently. Run sub 500m row or 25/30 calorie assault or echo bike.
