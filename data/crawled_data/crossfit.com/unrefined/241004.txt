Scaling:

Today’s workout is all about weightlifting stamina with a moderate-to-heavy barbell. Adjust the loading to maintain at least 3 reps per minute. Do not expect to perform many, if any, touch-and-go reps. Instead, focus on performing singles and managing your rest time between reps. Consider taking 5 to 20 seconds between reps, and remember to breathe.

Complete as many reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

Squat snatch

Coaching cues:

There is no “sneaking” under the barbell. James Brown said it best: “You gotta get up to get down.”
