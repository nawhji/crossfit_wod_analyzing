Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a ‚Äúchoose your own adventure.‚Äù Break up the reps and switch exercises in any fashion you choose. Expect the burpees to conflict with the wall-ball shots with regard to the pressing of the burpee and the throwing of the med ball. Because of this, you may consider smaller sets of each movement with more switching back and forth. Choose a loading for the wall-ball shots that allows you to complete at least 10 unbroken reps every time you pick it up. As for the burpees, breaking up 150 reps into smaller sets looks less daunting. Find a rep scheme that works for you.


Intermediate option:

For time:


120
 burpees


120

Partition the reps as needed to complete the work as quickly as possible.

Coaching cues:

Don‚Äôt waste time getting to the floor on your burpees. Gracefully ‚Äúfall‚Äù to the floor. This technique saves your arms from excessive fatigue and speeds up your burpee cycle time.
