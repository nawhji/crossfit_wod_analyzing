Scaling:

Welcome to the third workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! This workout challenges upper-body gymnastics endurance and stamina. While push-pull combos usually feel complementary, expect shoulder fatigue from the different handstand push-up variations to make the rope climbs and muscle-ups significantly more challenging. To find success in this workout, break up each movement into smaller sets than you need to unless you're an elite-level competitor. Advanced athletes should perform large sets early, but not at the expense of staying consistent during the muscle-ups at the end. Beginner athletes should treat this workout like a 15-minute AMRAP. Move smoothly through the first 10 minutes, then push hard to finish faster in the final 5 minutes. This should allow most athletes to stay consistent and avoid burning out toward the end.

Performed Rx but swapped the rope climbs for 4:1 rope pull up and thighs to elbows, then BMUs in place of RMUs.
I made it to the BMUs at 12:40 but could not get my act together to get more than 5 by time the clock hit 15min

Scaled way down to 15 min cap:
3 rounds: 10 pike push-ups + 20 toes to bar
2 rounds: 10 pike push-ups to 2" deficit + 15 L pull-ups
1 round: 10 HSPU + 2x [10 pull-ups + 10 ring dips]
*fatigue done me in: replaced final rd with 45s handstand hold + 10 jumping PU + 8 jumping dips (when bell rang)
L pull-ups were death. I used to cycle 7+ easy, before scapular neuropathy. Pain is gone now, but strength isn't back.

Scaled/subbed
3 rounds
10 piked pushups (feet on 30‚Äù box)
10 TTB
10 V-ups
2 rounds
10 piked pushups (same)
5 commando pull-ups per rope climb
1 round
10 piked pushups (same)
20 CTB pull-ups + 20 ring dips for 20 MUs
142 reps at the cap
Finished the last CTB/RD combo at 17:40
Left shoulder wasn‚Äôt digging the TTB, HSPU still not happening yet, no rope, and MUs definitely aren‚Äôt a thing in my garage, hence the scaling/subs.

Garage gym. No rope, subbed x5 unbroken cross grip pull up + K2E for each rope climb.  Rxd?
104 reps. 
learned how to kip HSPU right before this and still sucked at them. Definitely the majority of the time spent doing HSPUs.

Globo wod: see Thursday's note if you are doing these officially for a score.    Now for those of you who aren't and are at the Globo or garage, sub for hspu are dumbbell push jerks (first 3)/push presses (4-5th round)/strict presses(6th round) at 60-75 percent of your bodyweight total combined weight of the dumbbells.  If your pullup bar isn't suitable for kipping sub v-ups.  Sub 3 towel pullups for each rope climb, and for muscle ups if rings aren't available sub either bar muscleups  or 2 to 1 chest to bar pullups and TRX/weighted bar dips.
