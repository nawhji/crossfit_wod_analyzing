“Health, Longevity, and Superaging With CrossFit”


The “CrossFit Silvers” class is just like any other class at CrossFit Glasgow: full of people working hard, having fun, and making themselves better. Except there’s a bit more gray hair in this class than in others. “I don’t want to be struggling every day to get up and move,” says Wallis, who was recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis. “I want to be able to get up off the floor if I fall, or do my gardening, get out for a walk if I choose, be able to climb a hill.” That’s exactly what CrossFit Silvers is designed for, says affiliate owner Gavin Heselton.
