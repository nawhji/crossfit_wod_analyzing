800-meter run


‚ôÄ 35-lb dumbbells

‚ôÇ 50-lb dumbbells


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout got its inspiration from a Hero workout called Michael. We are still going to run 800 meters, however, we are going to do it at the end of the round to encourage you to move a little quicker, especially in the final round. The dumbbell deadlifts are replacing the back extensions and we‚Äôre doing GHD sit-ups instead of AbMat sit-ups. The loading of the dumbbells should be light and allow you to complete your reps in 3 sets or less. Some may be able to go unbroken. If you are not consistently using the GHD, it is not recommended to attempt the prescribed option. Scale the range of motion and the number of reps.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:

35 dumbbell deadlifts


20
 GHD sit-ups to 
parallel

800-meter run


‚ôÄ 
20
-lb dumbbells

‚ôÇ 
35
-lb dumbbells


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:


20
 dumbbell deadlifts


20
 sit-ups


400
-meter run


‚ôÄ 
10
-lb dumbbells

‚ôÇ 
15
-lb dumbbells


Coaching cues:

You should never lose the engagement of your abdominals as you lay back to perform a rep on the GHD. Choose a range of motion that allows you to stay engaged through your mid-section. While a wacky inflatable arm man is mesmerizing, it is never a good technique for your midline.

Yikes, that did not go like I thought it would even though I had a long distance between the GHD and rower.  Had to choose between GHD and row or AbMat and run due to equipment locations plus refusal to use a treadmill.
