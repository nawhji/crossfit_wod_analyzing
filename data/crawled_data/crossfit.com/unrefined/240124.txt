Scaling:

Today’s workout is a repeat of an Open workout from 2013. If you competed in 2013, check your score and go for a PR.


Both the load of the barbell and the height of the box should allow you to move through the reps quickly — the load should be light and the cycle time should be fast. A single round should take no more than 2 minutes to complete. Advanced athletes may be able to maintain 1 round per minute (maybe more).


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

5 shoulder-to-overheads

10 deadlifts

15 box jumps


♀ 45 lb, 20 inches
