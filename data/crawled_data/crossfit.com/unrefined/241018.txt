For time:

9 deadlifts

15 front squats

21 clean and jerks

‚ôÇ 315-lb deadlift, 225-lb front squat, 135-lb clean and jerk


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a play on Wednesday‚Äôs with a reverse rep scheme, but still a heavy sprint effort. Expect today‚Äôs workout to be slightly longer in terms of time domain, but the goal is to keep the barbell moving. Both the deadlifts and the front squats should feel pretty heavy while the clean and jerks may be more on the moderate side. When choosing loads for the workout, the deadlift should be unbroken, the front squats in 3 sets or less, and the clean and jerks should be performed in 4 minutes or less. Just like Wednesday, challenge yourself on this workout, but don‚Äôt make the weights so heavy that form is compromised.

9 deadlift

21 clean and jerks

Coaching cues:

Consider ‚Äúfast‚Äù singles on the clean and jerks in today‚Äôs workout. In doing so, follow the barbell down to the ground, minimize the bounce of the bar, take a breath, and hit your next rep.

Intermediate scale, 4:11.¬†
From a few weeks ago.¬† Unbroken deads and squats.¬† Did 3 clean & jerks to start and felt like that would prolong the rest periods, so just did singles after that.¬† Tried really hard to keep picking up the bar ‚Äì a couple quick breathers in the teens when I was worried I might fail the jerk (at 115 lol)!

Rx‚Äôd but I did use the rack to hold the bar between FS sets. No way I was cleaning 225 off the floor more than once.
12:58
DLs and C+Js went swell, FS were in sets of 3 and slow. Should‚Äôve scaled. Pride won today.

Globo wod: set up your barbell so you can make fast weight changes, if you are using a single bar.  Dumbbell sub deadlifts 80/115lbs, front squats 60/85lbs, clean and jerks 35/50lbs.  Men if the facility maxes out at 100lb dumbbells do 15 deadlifts.
