Workout of the Day

For max reps:

Tabata dumbbell box step-ups

Rest 1 minute

Tabata GHD sit-ups

Rest 1 minute

Tabata push presses

Rest 1 minute

Tabata bar-facing burpees


The Tabata interval is 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 intervals.


♀ 20-lb dumbbells, 20-inch box, and 65-lb barbell

♂ 35-lb dumbbells, 24-inch box, and 95-lb barbell


Post total calories/reps for each exercise to comments.


Stimulus and Strategy:

Today’s workout is a Tabata mash-up. Complete the full 8 rounds of the first movement before moving on to the next. Continue in the same fashion until all four movements are complete. Your score is the total number of reps completed. The loading of both the dumbbells and the barbell should be light and allow you to keep moving. If you have not been training consistently on the GHD, reduce the range of motion or substitute with AbMat sit-ups.


Scaling:

Reduce the total volume of the workout by limiting the number of reps performed within each interval. Reduce the loading of the dumbbells and barbell. Lower the height of the box.


Limit the range of motion on the GHD sit-ups by going to parallel or performing AbMat sit-ups. For the push presses, consider using a pair of lighter dumbbells. As for the bar-facing burpees, perform up-downs or step over the bar.


In case of injury or limitation, perform the box step-ups without a pair of dumbbells and lower the height of the box. Perform a plank hold for the GHD sit-ups. For the push presses, perform a single-arm dumbbell push press or shoulder press. For the bar-facing burpees, perform an up-down or pick any machine to use in place of the exercise.

As rx'd, 202 reps.
Box step-up:  5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5
GHD Sit-up:  8-9-8-9-8-9-8-9
Push Press:  9-8-8-7-7-5-5-5
B-F Burpee:  5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5
Step-ups and burpees were rough, but it’s only 20 seconds, so I was able to sustain sets of 5 for each.  GHDs were like rest time.  Could have pushed to get 9 each round but was
saving myself a bit.  Suspected push press would fall off – the stamina for this builds up.  
Happy New Year!

16” step-ups with 15lb dumbbells 7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7 = 7/56
Ab-Towel sit-ups 7-7-6-6-5-5-5-6 = 5/47
15lb dumbbells push-presses 14-13-13-12-11-10-8-8 = 8/89

GHD Sit ups to parallel
Push press @ 95# 
Bar facing burpees

Scaled
20" Box step-ups 25# DBs
AbMat Situps (butterfly, unanchored)
Push Press 65#
Bar facing Burpees
50-80-105-40 = 275 reps
Not a max effort but just kept moving, though at a greater pace than intended.  Don't let the reps fool anyone - feeling under the weather so I heavily scaled with intent to just check the box today but have trouble slowing things down once I get moving. I'm sure to pay for that later.

I counted everything together, so I don’t know how many of each exercise I did.
It was a tough one

Good one to finish the year. Added this to my strict press lifting session so push press was harder than it should have been. Total score 214. Scaled the GHD for ab mat sit ups. Happy New Years.

Globo wod: dumbells sub for the push presses are to use the same dumbbells for the box step ups, and to do burpees facing the dumbbells. Ghd situps sub situps sitting perpendicular on a bench with your feet under heavy dumbbells and do situps touching the ground behind you or abmat stick situps. For box stepups step up to a bench or do weighted stationary lunges at the same weight.
