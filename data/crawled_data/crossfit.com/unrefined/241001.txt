Single-arm Russian kettlebell swings, right arm

Single-arm Russian kettlebell swings, left arm

Kettlebell goblet squats


‚ôÄ 53 lb

‚ôÇ 70 lb


Scaling:

There is one goal for today's workout: hang on to the kettlebell for as long as possible. The loading of the kettlebell should allow you to perform at least 10 single-arm swings every time you pick up the bell. The same is true for the goblet squats. Try to hang on for bigger sets, and don‚Äôt put the kettlebell down when you get to your set of 10. Aim to complete today‚Äôs workout in 10 minutes or less.


Intermediate option:

30-20-10 reps for time of:

Single-arm Russian kettlebell swings, right arm

Single-arm Russian kettlebell swings, left arm

Kettlebell goblet squats

Honestly thought the grip was the worst at times getting up in the reps.
I haven't posted a main site time in a bit. Need to when I do one.

Compounding factors today: no KB, used 45&25lb plates strapped together. My lower back is already spent from tiling a bathroom over the wknd. I then redlined in the first round going unbroken on 30, bad idea, had a hard time recovering after that.

15:50 used 28kg/62lbs. Probably should have scaled down to 53lbs but maintained the 10 reps for each set just food breaks in between.

55# was heavy and much harder than it looked. 70 would have been brutal. Great job!

Coming back after a break, so cut in half:
15-10-5 @ 70 lbs
Single arm russian KB swings
KB Goblet squats 
9:48 still hard even at 50%
Edit: did everything with a dumbbell, somehow my gym decided to get rid of the 70lbs KBs.
