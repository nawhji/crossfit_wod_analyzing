Scaling:

Today’s workout is a burner and there is no reason to stop moving. Experienced athletes should sell their sousl on the rower and hold their heads above water on the burpee pull-ups. Beginner athletes should pace the row and move consistently on the burpee pull-ups. To make the burpee pull-ups easier, use a bar closer to your fingertips when arms are overhead, allowing you to perform more of a jumping pull-up.


Intermediate option:

21-15-9 reps for time of:

Calorie row

Burpee pull-ups

*Pull-up bar 
1
 inch from fingertips with arms overhead.


Beginner option:


15-12-9

Pull-up bar between forearm and elbow
 with arms overhead.
