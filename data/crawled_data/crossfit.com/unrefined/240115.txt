Scaling:

Today’s goal is to lift something heavy for 2 repetitions across 5 sets. Remember, heavy is relative to each individual's capacity, but regardless, each effort should require your full focus and attention. If you know your percentages, aim to keep all sets at or above 75% of your 1-rep-max clean. Continue to increase the load across as many sets as possible. Each set of 2 cleans must be completed unbroken and start from above the knee.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d


Beginner option:

For load:


4-4-4-4-4

Hang squat cleans

2HangSquatClean+ PushJerk
Did this one as a complex similar 230728 (that I did on my birthday?). Included a jerk since I haven't done a heavy jerk in a while and don't see one programmed this week. 
Wanted to just do PowerCleans, but I did a heavy session of front squats before. Good call doing front squats instead of back squats. Squat cleans were the heaviest I've ever done, since I usually default to PowerCleans. Jerks felt good. Good Lift.

Should've pushed more,  but I had to lift with the garage doors open.   It was 13 degrees.

Practice day - heavy was not happening.
10 reps each weight
45-65-75-85-95#
Did 1 set of 2 at 115# just to check if mechanics changed with the 20# increase - nope. Did SLIPS as part of warmup and practiced DUs in between HC sets.

I’ve never done this movement before so this was more of a technique workout for me. 
on my fourth set I threw the bar up too high and smashed my jaw, so then I had the taste of blood in my mouth to help fuel me for the last set 😅

Globo wod: If you are using iron plates today do heavy sets across using the same weight and use a weight that you can bring down under control.   Dumbbells sub dumbbell hang squat cleans 2-2-2-2-2.  If you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
"Oh you went platinum, yeah, that's nice / now let me see you do the same thing twice" - Nas
Big fan of a two-rep max in general, and any max involving more than one rep. Coming from a sports background, I think a 2-rep max translates to sports more than one because plays in basketball and football and volleyball don't seem to be single-effort things; linemen got to block the same dude more than once within 7 seconds or so, basketball defender needs two fight over two screens (stop going under or switching screens you pansies!), a block at the volleyball net might lead to another one in a few seconds. Maintaining peak(ish) strength over extended durations is not too far off the definition of fitness.
MAIN DECISION
What constitutes "unbroken"? I've been thinking about this critically in my coaching recently, and I'm starting to believe that doing 1 hang clean, then taking a few breaths with the bar in the hang position before doing the next one is not really unbroken. Might as well set it down - and there's nothing wrong with that.
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM
HEAVY	x
I WANT TO GO HEAVY BUT DON'T HAVE THE TECHNIQUE ON CLEANS TO DO SO SCALE
Max effort deadlift. Then practice hang cleans in the warmup
I WANT TO WORK ON POWER AND SPEED BUT DON'T HAVE THE TECHNIQUE FOR CELANS SCALE
Spend 20 minutes finding a max height box jump (spotters are nice here; if you don't have one, go highest you can without risk of missing a rep). Practice hang cleans in the warmup
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE SQUAT BUT DON'T HAVE THE TECHNIQUE TO DO IT WITH SPEED SCALE
Max effort front squats instead of cleans.
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Same format, do 10+ reps per set
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 3
