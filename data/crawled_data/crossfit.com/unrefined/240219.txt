Scaling:

Today’s workout is short, but don’t let it fool you — it will get spicy. If you attempt the prescribed handstand walk, allow no more than 45 seconds to complete it. If you want to practice your handstand walk but the distance is too far, reduce to no less than 15 feet. The kettlebell swings should be moderately heavy and unbroken for as many rounds as possible. Can you hold on for 1 round per minute? Maybe more?


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

20 
alternating shoulder taps against the wall

10 kettlebell swings


♀ 35 lb


♂ 53 lb


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 8 minutes of:

20 
alternating shoulder taps in a plank position

10 
Russian
 kettlebell swings


♀ 18 lb


♂ 26 lb

M/33/5'7"/219lbs
AMRAP (8:00) 7Rds + 5 ( Finished 8Rds)
10 KBSwings 50lbs (Russian)
20 PlankTouches to Shoulders
Did this one on a core/running/rowing day.  Did Russian know swings as I did not realize American swings were prescribed. Don't think I've ever done American swings. Read Glassman old article from CF journal and realized the prescription difference. Oh well, I'll have to read the fine print next time. Plank touches were sloppy and just tired my shoulders. Probs won't do those again for a while for reps. 
Wish I could just chuck the KB on my last rep, but that's just not cool.

As rx'd, 5 rounds + 8 swings.
HS walk after swings was spicy.  Walks didn’t degrade too much; still it look ~3 attempts per round to cover the distance.

8 min AMRAP
20 alternating shoulder taps (wall facing - about halfway up)
10 AKBS (35# DB, heaviest I have)
6rds + squeezed in a 20sec HS hold (back to wall) at the end
Wasn’t much today but it was something, and something is better than nothing. I’ll see how this plays out with the elbows later.

Globo wod: dumbbell sub are dumbbell swings 35/55lb dumbbells. Handstand walks can be done in as little as 5ft increments if space is an issue. If your globo doesn't allow handstand walks do heavy double dumbbell carries for 50 ft or holds overhead for 30 seconds per round.  Note weight of dumbbells used.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Man it is crazy how much CrossFit has evolved in terms of fitness standards. Just take a minute to appreciate what is being asked of today's workout: handstand walks in an 8 minute workout! Do you have any idea how well-rounded and fit you have to be for Diane to be a rough conditioning dose? And now (in kind of a version of Diane if you think about it) upping the skill of handstands? I think it can be easy to get caught in the CrossFit bubble and take our fitness for granted. Most of us can't do what professional athletes do, but I'd bet most of them can't do handstand walks and kettlebell swings at peak intensity either.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Am I dope enough at CrossFit for this thing to be like a 7 out of 10 on intensity?
Do I want to scale for intensity (sub handstand walks for something you can do intense) or scale for skill (keep handstand walks and extend time)?
Am I good enough at handstands to have a set distance or do I need to give al allotted time to practice?
Do I preserve the upside-downness of handstand walks when subbing (hs hold/hspu) or just keep with the shoulder stimulus (push press, strict press, overhead walk)?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Set a timer for 30 minutes and practice handstands and deadlifts. Kb swings at high reps can be rough for new kids

Nice. I’m definitely not dope enough at CF to hit this Rx, but the questions definitely made me think about how I wanted to tackle this.
