Scaling:

Build throughout the 8 sets, starting with something moderately heavy and finishing with a very heavy single. Remember that “heavy” is relative to each athlete. A heavy load requires all your focus and effort.


– A heavy set of 10 reps should be around 50-60%+.

– A heavy set of 7 reps should be around 60-70%.

– A heavy set of 4 reps should be around 70-80%.

– A heavy single for today should be 80%+.
