Scaling:

Expect to go around and around the merry-go-round in today’s workout. The rep volume is low, and so is the loading. This should allow you to push the pace for the entire duration of the workout. Advanced athletes should try to maintain unbroken reps for as many sets as possible. Less-experienced athletes should scale the movements to perform a single round in 2 minutes or less. That said, we could see advanced athletes maintaining a single round every minute.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 10 minutes of:


8 
jumping
 ring dips

8 sumo deadlift high pulls

16 double-unders


♀ 55 lb


♂ 75 lb

Complete as many reps as possible in 10 minutes of:


8 
foot-assisted
