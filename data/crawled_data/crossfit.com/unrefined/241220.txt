3 rounds for time of:

9 strict handstand push-ups


‚ôÄ 105-lb barbell and 20-inch box

‚ôÇ 155-lb barbell and 24-inch box


Post time to comments.


Stimulus and Strategy:

Today‚Äôs workout is a short-to-moderate duration effort and is going to take some mental fortitude to push through the front squats. The goal is to choose a weight you can hang on to for all 21 reps. This shouldn‚Äôt be easy, but it also shouldn‚Äôt be extremely hard. It should be a grind. After the front squats, be careful on your first box jump. Plan to jump a little higher than you think you need to. For the handstand push-ups, choose an option that allows you to complete your reps in 1 minute or less.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell and the height of the box.


Maintain the stimulus of the jump unless you have an injury or limitation, in which case you can switch to a step-up. For the handstand push-ups, consider performing dumbbell shoulder presses, or pike push-ups.


In case of injury or limitation, perform your squats to a target or perform air squats. For the box jumps, reduce the height and perform step-ups or 30 seconds on the bike. For the handstand push-ups, consider a single dumbbell shoulder press or push-ups from the knees.

Coaching cues:

When you are front squatting, find a spot on the wall above your natural gaze. This spot is where you want to drive your elbows throughout each of your reps.

As rx‚Äôd, 12:56.
This went pretty well. ¬†I was concerned about that volume of front squats, but they were okay. ¬†Broke them 7-7-7 for all rounds.¬† Slow and steady on the box jumps ‚Äì again, those went pretty well considering the tax on the legs from the squats.¬† HSPUs unbroken except round 3 (7-1-1) ‚Äì the shoulders were very fatigued, presumably from the strain of holding the barbell in front squats.

Reflection:
Felt good going today, and I crushed the WOD. Good workout today HQ, it actually was kinda fun. Need to work on strengthening my wrist tho, anyone have any tips on how to do that? @everyone
Otherwise, excited to do the next day. Today‚Äôs warmup was chest and it was worth doing today.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead.
15 Min AMRAP
250m row
10 KBS (55#)
10 Pull-ups
5 rds
3 min rest, then
For Time (15 min cap)
80 Burpees
80 WBS (20#, 10‚Äô)
13:36
Came up with this sort of on the fly this morning, pulling from previous WODs with available gear and space in mind.  Doing the AMRAP first made that burp/WBS combo that much worse.

Globo wod: Dumbbell sub 50/75lbs dumbbells for front squats. If 50lbs is the top dumbbell weight men do 30 dumbbell front squats per round. Sub for box jumps are jumps to a bench or other appropiate platform.  If handstand pushups aren't feasible sub dumbbell strict presses at 60-75 percent of your bodyweight total combined weight of the dumbbells.
