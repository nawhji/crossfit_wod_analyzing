Scaling:

Approach the first run a little differently than the second. Hit the first run hard, but leave enough in the tank to get right to work on the middle portion of the workout. Attack the second run with everything you have left. The loading of the barbell should allow you to perform all sets unbroken. Spend no more than :30 performing double-unders.

For time:

800-meter run

5 HangCleans 95lbs
30 SingleUnders
0.5Miles -(4:00)
Did this one after a quick heavy squat session. Runs were at a tempo pace, went hard but did not redline. Cleans were irrelevant, probably could've felt similar with 20 more lbs at 115lbs. SingleUnders were the focus. Not one round unbroken, but not too many mess ups.  Got a good sweat doing the rounds but was less intense than the runs. Almost felt like a chipper. Last run felt good. Just checked the box as a good tempo run workout with a little heart rate interference.

Completed 2/1 as a make up WOD. Time constrained so I only did the middle portion, 10 rounds of x5 HPC, 30 DUs. 
14:14
couldnt imagine running after that one! DUs were some of my better work only tripping up in about 3/10 rounds.

As rx‚Äôd, 23:38.
My double-unders suck but I did them all today.¬† Did have one unbroken set, but mostly they were trash.¬† Unbroken HPCs.¬† First run 3:40, last run about 3:30 ‚Äì pedal to
the metal, but that was all I could muster.

Opted for the email version:
800m run
5 rounds of
20 KB swings (russian), 1 pood
0:30 DUs lim 40
800m run
20:32
Expected <19, but I had 
nothing
 left to "attack the run" after 100 KBs and 200 DUs. Last 800m ate almost 6mins (ouch!). On the positive: 40 DUs before 30s every round.

Today‚Äôs workout, scaled to 95# HPCs and 50 single unders with a weighted rope.
32:03
~3 min transitions getting out of and into running shoes and winter wear. HPC warm ups in running shoes were comical as I tried to find a stable base with squishy shoes and elevated heels. 
2024 and we‚Äôre off and running, literally and metaphorically!

Welcome Leah!  Normally we log total time - see how fast you can get through the whole WOD, so you don't want to dilly dally between WOD sections, because the clock is still ticking.  But I also keep track of the individual section times, like you have.

Globo wod: If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline. Subs are 1000m row or 55 calories assault or echo bike.  Dumbbells sub 35/50lb dumbbells, (intermediate 25/35lb, scaled 15/20lb).
