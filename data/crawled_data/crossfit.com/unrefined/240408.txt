Did this as a conditioning piece after doing Randy earlier. First row was strong, last ones had no more gas in tank. Abs started cramping after round 3. Hip felt ok, but noticeable. First time trying V-Ups.

Completed post 240409 at the Y. Air assault runner was not working so I subbed 400m rows. 
6-11-10-11-9 = 47
each row left me 23-30 seconds to move over to the bar and start K2E. Went way too slow the first round on those, the rest were quick focused efforts.

Had to do this very late with little warm-up due to travel.
Intermediate (best measure with my phone)
15/14/13/12/12
That video helped with improving KTE cycling but I had to come off the bar more than I should as the left shoulder wasn’t happy with full overhead extension under load today.
Great job everyone!

Oh yeah, the runs started at the bar, around a building over asphalt, concrete, and grass of varying levels and slopes, and back to the bar. Kept them all between 1:08 and 1:10.

I am only 2 weeks post-op from a breast augmentation so I cannot run or hang from a bar (yet).   
 Below is my modification using what equipment and space was in our apartment gym.
0.5 mile AirDyne Bike Sprint + V-Ups
(Bike sprint took roughly 1:20-1:35 each set)
Reps completed each set 12,11, 11, 14, 12 :)

@Chris, no music today, went to my local park. Runs were true CF runs - unruly terrain, never straight for very long, dogs, grandmas to avoid bumping into etc. 
1:25 - 8
1:3? - 7
1:33 - 6
1:37 - 6
1:40 - 6
I must say I really love the programming in 2024!

Good looks Patrick. Not every workout needs to be able to be a Compare-to. Running on that terrain and finding a swing set or tree to do knees to elbows on is a great way to practice for the unknown and unknowable.

Globo wod: subs for runs are 500m row or 27 calories assault or echo bike.  If you are using a conventional treadmill for runs use a slight incline.  Sub V-ups for knees to elbows if a pullup bar isn't available.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Anyone within earshot for more than a few minutes will undoubtedly hear me bring up an obscure hip hop reference at any opportunity I can find, or otherwise just start rapping to myself the hundreds of verses from Eminem, Lupe, 3 Stacks, or Jay-Z that have been permanently stored in this concussed brain. And it is with that same enthusiasm for the art form that I get so frustrated with the current state of hip hop; mumble rap, trap drums... well, I guess I really can't give specific examples because I don't really follow the new stuff. But of course, hip hop always makes me eat my words because you never know when J. Freaking Cole will drop an unexpected album that makes me shut everything down and listen front to back twice in a row like I'm 17 again. How is this going to tie into CrossFit, you ask? Two ways (also a Lupe song). 
First, when I stopped playing music at the gym, is was only partially because of not wanting to pay the ASCAP bills, it was mainly because I wanted to showcase the voices that were already in there: my voice and our athletes voices needed to be projected with no distractions. But a surprise byproduct of taking music away was a new voice was exposed: our athletes' voice they use to talk to themselves. And man... we have unearthed some serious negativity that people were telling themselves that might have been covered up by A Tribe Called Quest or... uh... whatever those country fans listened to. Try taking out music for a week of workouts and take note what is going on in your head. Are you encouraging or discouraging yourself? How often do you blank out? Does your mind stay on task of wonder off? These workouts are so tough and designed specifically to make us fail, which means there is absolutely zero tolerance and no room for being negative towards yourself. You need every bit of help possible to make it through these things and it is good not to rely on a coach or a workout playlist for that.
Secondly, it's ironic that Cole dropped and this workout popped up; for all the criticism I have made about the WODs on here and the current state of CrossFit, this workout is fire. Simple, elegant, on beat, and deadly. Listen to yourself as you run: are you telling yourself that you need to pace? Because that is also saying you don't have trust in your fitness to recover? What was going on in your head when you came down from knees to elbows? Was it muscle or lung fatigue? Or mental fatigue? Was your grip really failing or were you just looking for the first excuse possible to come off the bar? For those willing and able, this could be an 8 or 9 if you talk yourself into it. Great workout design fellas!
SCALING QUESTIONS
See rant
Do I have the physical capacity to sprint 400 meters?
Do I have the strength and stamina (and flexibility) to make knees to elbows a conditioning exercise?
Am I willing to go intense enough to earn a 2 minute rest?
Is Kendrick going to respond back to Cole?
Am I experienced enough to have a time cap on the knees to elbows?
If I'm scaling, do I want to preserve the movements and lower the ROM or pick two different movements I can do at full intensity?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
5 rounds for time of:
20 kipping knees to elbows
Run 400 meters

Good rant, Chris. When I’m really dialed in, the music helps me focus/push harder. When I’m a little off, it serves as a distraction. Too often, I’m in the latter camp it seems.

Yeah man, music or lack thereof can have a huge impact for most.  I agree that turning the music off and listening to what your mind and body are saying is a good thing to do from time-to-time at a minimum. I equate it to turning your car’s radio off occasionally and listening for any out of the ordinary noise(s).
Not so much for me - I like to have music but it doesn’t impact my performance either way as I’ve been forced to go without so many times during the last 3 decades. The one exception where it makes the workout performance somewhat better (ie. enjoyable) for me is when a 10km run/row/ride (or more) comes up - you know, monostructural and monotonous for a long time.

Man Lincoln, my car CD player/radio/speaker system has been down for 3 or 4 years. All silence for me. Luckily I walk to the gym every day (or dribble a basketball).

love the rant, crazy what you hear others say and sometimes do while doing a WOD period easy or taxing!!! i know at times i say bad words to myself as motivation to create anger and fight to push myself. i look at it as positive motivation. And for my musical choice, lol it country. old bluegrass not the new style country
