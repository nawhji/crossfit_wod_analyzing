Post times to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout challenges you to push the pace on each run and go unbroken on the couplet in the middle. Do your best not to ‚Äúgame‚Äù this workout. Instead, hit the first run hard and then get ready to find your hip flexors. Choose an option for the toes-to-bar that allows you to complete each round in 2 sets or less. As for the box jump-over, use a height that allows you to keep moving and finish your reps in less than a minute. On the last run, give it everything you have left.


Intermediate option:

For time:

400-meter run


Then,

5 rounds of:

10 
knees-to-chests

10 box jump-overs


Then,

400-meter run

‚ôÇ

Beginner option:

For time:

200-meter run


Then,

5 rounds of:

10 
hanging knee raises

10 box 
step-overs


Then,

200-meter run


‚ôÄ

-inch box

‚ôÇ 
20
-inch box


Coaching cues:

During the box jump-overs, land low on the top of the box. Then begin to pivot on top of the box and step down. This pivot sets you up to face the box as you step down and go right into your next jump.

Wanted to do Joe in celebration of Joe Lengel‚Äôs life, but after 1 round and Linda yesterday, the body said ‚Äúno.‚Äù  So‚Ä¶
500m row, then
5 rounds of 
10 TTB, arms in straps
10 box jump overs, 24‚Äù
57 single unders 
then 500m row
18:01
Rest in peace Joe, knowing you changed many lives. And beyond me why Joe doesn‚Äôt have an official workout named in his honor.

Nicely done Jim! I like how you added the singles in. Like you, parts of my body were not going to sustain both today, but I also did my workout before seeing Aaron‚Äôs post so didn‚Äôt manage to adopt any of it like you did.

Could have shaved time by doing KTC vice TTB but after the first round with TTB I decided to stick with that. Rows were 1:42 and 1:40 respectively - not sprints but definitely an uncomfortable pace. Full stand up and step down on BJO. The knees were not going to accept a 30" BJO today.

(10 rounds)
Joe Lengel Jr., 57, of Toledo, OH, died on November 19, 2012, of a gunshot wound sustained while opening his gym, Crossfit Intensity. Surviving Joe are his wife of 32 years, Karen; sons, Aaron (Kendra) and Matt; daughter, Mary Beth; grandchildren, Aiden, Kolbrin, Kamden, Atley, Avelyn, Koralyn, Aaron II, Layla and Reis. Joe was preceded in death by his grandson Kelan.
"CrossFit is about exploring your personal potential. It‚Äôs why people climb mountains. It‚Äôs not really about the mountain. It‚Äôs about how deep you can travel into your own perceived limits. We all experience transcendence when we move beyond our previous best. I get nervous before a WOD because I know I will come face to face with my own negative internal chatter. ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôre not good enough. You‚Äôre not strong enough. Etc.‚Äù I win when I try once again. I win when you win because I‚Äôm watching to celebrate your personal triumph. Only those who try get it.
It‚Äôs not about CrossFit it‚Äôs about that." -Joe Lengel, October 29th 2012

My thoughts to you & your family on this sad anniversary of a tragic day. Thank you for sharing your story & your father's words & for honoring his legacy in this way, which gives many a chance to do the same. I'll be adding this to today's WOD later.

Thoughts to your and your family. I would be right there with Favo doing this in conjunction with the WOD but alas the knees nor time will comply today. I feel HQ should program this every November 19th.

intensity scaled to nasal-breathing
volume scaled to 50%
Did one box jump to 39in / 100cm just to try.
too much going on currently, so I need to scale aggressively on order to not get sick
