Workout of the Day
93
Every 1 minute, complete:

1 wall walk

3 deadlifts

5 toes-to-bars


Every minute, add 2 toes-to-bars. Complete as many rounds as possible until failure.


‚ôÄ 125 lb

‚ôÇ 185 lb


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a bit of a ‚Äúbeep test.‚Äù While the first round is seemingly simple, each passing minute gets more challenging. The loading of the deadlift should be moderate and something you can perform 3 reps of easily. The single wall walk and 3 deadlifts should take no more than 20 seconds to complete, leaving at least 40 seconds to perform toes-to-bars. If the wall walk and deadlifts are taking longer than the intended time, reduce the range of motion of the wall walk and the loading of the deadlift. Scale the toes-to-bars to something that is not going to hold you back. In other words, if you can only do 2-3 toes-to-bars in a row before breaking, scale to something that allows you to hang on the bar longer and complete bigger sets.


Intermediate option:

Every 1 minute, complete:

1 wall walk

3 deadlifts

5 
knees-to-chests


Every minute, add 2 knees-to-chests. Complete as many rounds as possible until failure.


‚ôÄ 
95
 lb

‚ôÇ 
135
 lb


Beginner option:

Every 1 minute, complete:

1 
inchworm

3 deadlifts

5 
hanging knee raises


Every minute, add 2 hanging knee raises. Complete as many rounds as possible until failure.


‚ôÄ 
55
 lb

‚ôÇ 
75
 lb


Coaching cues:

On the toes-to-bar, press down against the pull-up bar and lean back. The further your shoulder is behind the bar, the easier it will be to touch your toes to it.

Done on 241012
Rx rep scheme scaled to:
1 inchworm 
155# DLs
KTC
9rds + 19 KTC (finished 23 at +:10)
Rested about 2 minutes then did 3 untimed rounds of scaled 241012:
15 Deficit Pushups on some old Perfect Push-up bars
24 unweighted walking lunge steps
Felt fairly tender in a few spots going in hence the scaling but also wanted to get some of both WODs in.

i was most interested in the deads, so Rx weight. Can‚Äôt cycle TTB quickly in the arm straps, but I can with KTE, so KTE it was. 
5-7-9-11-13-12 before time ran out, though I finished the round of 15. Finished with
deadlift 5-5-5 at 185-245-245#. 
135# seemed pretty light as an intermediate scale for this workout; I don‚Äôt think 185 was any slower than 135 would have been.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead, though it was much less intense than usual this time.
We ran around the area seeking out pull-up bars (or other acceptable objects to grip) and did a set of pull-ups at each one.
Distance run: 3.35 miles; Pull-ups completed: 75 (+20 push-ups because we felt like stopping and doing something else).  Lasted somewhere around 40 minutes.
Though I am not a fan of running, this was rather enjoyable.  I did another 25 pull-ups between stretches to finish out 100, because why not.  I meant to do some of today's WOD as well but the left wrist was not happy with wall walks during my warm-up, and I still have about 600# of stones to move this afternoon.

Sounds fun! Very organic, spontaneous style workout! Moving so many stones sounds slightly less fun. You should have made it the workout, two birds with 600# of stones :D

Rx
Morning WOD, fell apart a few reps short of the 5th round (4r + 14).
Abs are still toasty from GHDs.
I felt like tapped out early so I completed another 5 rounds of the first round after the WOD

Garage gym felt nice and chilly this morning! Still dealing with some grip/hand issues so subbed in ring leg lifts for TTB.
5-7-9-11-13-10*
Went up to 19 reps after completing some slower rounds. Maybe it was the chill but this one didn't seem to break too much of a sweat before I ran out of time.

Globo wod: dumbbell sub dumbbell deadlifts 50/75 lb dumbbells. If the pullup bar isnt conducive to kipping sub one of the scaled options or V- ups, preferably with a pvc pipe or baroom stick.   If wall walks are prohibited by your globo or are not feasible due to setup sub 2 inchworms per each wall walk.
