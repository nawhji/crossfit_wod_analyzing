Scaling:

This benchmark workout was 
first posted
 on CrossFit.com on Aug. 25, 2003. When the community was introduced to Fran, CrossFit’s founder Greg Glassman challenged people to beat original CrossFit athlete Greg Amundson's time of 3:59. Today, elite athletes complete the prescribed workout in under 2 minutes. Fran is intended to be a sprint. Experienced athletes should go hard and shoot for a PR! Choose a load for the thruster that allows you to complete at least 15 unbroken reps. Select a pull-up option that allows you to complete each round with minimal rest. Intermediate and beginner athletes should establish a goal for this workout and create a plan for breaking up the thrusters and/or pull-ups as necessary.


Intermediate option:

For time:

21-15-9 reps of thrusters

12-9-6 reps of pull-ups


♀ 55 lb


♂ 75 lb


Beginner option:

21-15-9 reps for time of:

Thrusters


Ring rows


♀ 35 lb


♂ 45 lb


Resources:


The Thruster


The Pull-Up


The Ring Row

Globo wod...As Rx.  Be careful if you are using iron plates.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell thrusters 25/40lb dumbbells. Make sure you warm up the movements well before doing this.  This is an all out Sprint,  scale with that intention.
 If you can't kip due to the type of pullup bar, you are doing strict Fran today.   If you are in a hotel gym without a pullup bar sub lat pulldowns and db thrusters 25/40lb dbs.  Bodyweight sub 21-15-9 burpees touching 6" over reach and pullups.
