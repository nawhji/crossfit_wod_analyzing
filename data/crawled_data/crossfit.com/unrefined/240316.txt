Scaling:

Today we have an ascending ladder of ring dips and burpees paired with a consistent number of hang power cleans. The load of the barbell is moderately heavy and should allow you to complete 5 reps in 2 sets or less. Advanced athletes may be able to maintain unbroken reps throughout the workout. Athletes performing the ring dips as prescribed should be able to maintain consistent sets of 3-5 unbroken reps. Expect the ring dips and burpees to cause localized muscle fatigue and the hang power cleans to be a welcomed ‚Äúbreak.‚Äù Work hard and have fun today!


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 12 minutes of:


1
 ring dip

2 burpees

5 hang power cleans


2
 ring dips

4 burpees

5 hang power cleans


3

5 hang power cleans, etc.


*Continue adding 1 rep to the ring dips and 2 reps to the burpees until time expires.

Was really tired and body felt taxed. Was going to do some conditioning after, but mind and body said no. Probably should've had more BarDips, since the burpees just gassed me out.

2 burpees
5 HPC (45.5 kg) etc.
Adding 2 reps as stated

No rings so did bar dips. I would love to do ring dips again as it is more challenging and beneficial.

I was a pretty solid CrossFitter in my day 2009-2020. Made Regionals on a team in 2018, won some local comps, and had a great time. Life got in the way and I transitioned over to powerlifting, but I always did a metcon here and there just for funsies.
I‚Äôve been f‚Äôing around with the Open and having some fun. This one was doable in my garage, so I tried it.

Intermediate. 
8 rounds + 9 dips + 8 burpees. 164 reps if my math is accurate. 
wanted to go intermediate to keep the barbell unbroken. Dips would have been tough as well as RXd.

I did 24.3 today and have a happy rant‚Ä¶
I have been more pleased with this year‚Äôs Open wods than ever before. I feel like CrossFit got it right this year making Rx workouts accessible to intermediate athletes while allowing room for the elite athletes to shine. As a solid intermediate and very short athlete, I had gotten used to feeling crushed by workouts like 19.1, 16.4 repeated again as 17.4 (I never got to do HSPUs in an Open workout until 2019‚Äîafter dipping out of 2018 early due to injury), and 23.3 (HSPUs start 4‚Äô7‚Äù from the wall?! I‚Äôm 4‚Äô8‚Äù!). Demoralizing. After 19.1, I waited until seeing the first workout before deciding whether or not to sign up for the Open, and I am so glad to have signed up this year. Not only the first workout, but I feel like the subsequent workouts have also showcased my athletic capabilities. I have not done the open every year since I started, but for the first time ever, I feel like the Open has highlighted my strengths instead of turning non-strength features into handicaps. I am both grateful and invigorated, feeling included and capable! Thank you to whoever dreamed up this year‚Äôs Open workouts!

M/49/6'2"/185#
Scaled/modified to strict ring dips, burpees as rx'd, 53# DxKB cleans, and the rep scheme as rx'd...
7 rds + 13 dips in the round of 16's
160 reps total 
Those dips and burpees got real after the round of 10's good luck suspects

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Nothing to rant about
SCALING QUESTIONS
Do you see the workout being more shaded towards getting better at CrossFit or getting better at something outside of CrossFit?
Do you want shoulder fatigue to play a factor in intensity?
Is the form good enough on all movements that attention can be paid to rep scheme and not the movement, itself?
Will these burpees be throwaway conditioning pieces or will they be a continuation of jumping/landing practice we get with cleans?
Am I fit enough to have rings feel like conditioning in a 12-minute workout?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
7 rounds of:
1:00 ring practice
1:00 hang clean practice
1:00 box jump practice
