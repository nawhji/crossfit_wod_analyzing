Scaling:

Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. For an advanced athlete, each round is a sprint. Put your foot on the gas pedal and hold on. The load of the barbell is light enough that you should push to maintain unbroken sets for all 3 rounds. Remember to stand up completely on top of the box in the box jumps. Newer athletes should reduce the deadlift load to a weight that can be completed in 2 sets or less while maintaining good technique.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:

500-meter row

12 deadlifts

21 box jumps


♀ 20 in, 
105 lb

♂ 20 in, 
155 lb


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:

400-meter row

M/33/5'7"/219lbs
3Rds ~ (20:00)
Row500m (2:00)
12 DeadLift 155lbs (6,6)
21 BoxJumps 24in (10,11)
Pushed for a 2;00 min row. That was tough. Transitions were far at the powergym. DeadLift were easy but a little leg tiring. BoxJumps were the workout. Broke up into 2 sets per round. Gassed at the end but conditioning is still there, just a little bodyweight heavy. Gassed but rested enough to not redline.

12:20 Rx, 165# DL. Rower is busted and doesn't keep track so I just rowed for 2 min each round
this one was really fun! Completed it a few minutes after today's WOD. I think my legs are going to be sore tomorrow!

Rx (well...as close to Rx as plates available)
185#
13:28
Compare to 221117: 12:24, same weight but did tuck jumps instead (no box or platform just a rickety old bench)
BJs were all full stand up/step down.  Rows were 1:47, 1:50, 1:49 (C2, drag 5).  DLs unbroken.  Didn't keep a close eye on the timer but I felt like I was moving faster than I was - had to be the BJs.  However, I consider today more of a win despite being slower on time - BJs are more work than tuck jumps and take longer when doing full stand up/step down.

What is a body weight deadlift? Does that mean to deadlift your body weight or a calisthenics version of a deadlift?

rows at 2:07-2:09
DL unbroken 
too many blows during the box jumps. Similar to what Chris pointed out in an earlier rant, anyone can do just one more 20” box jump, if the Will is there. Clearly not for me today.

Chris, regards your comment the other day, I didn’t even know what a lacrosse stick looked like when I took my U9 (I think) son to sign up for the first time. I learned how to catch and throw to play catch with him. He played thru HS and some club LAX in college. What a great sport.

Globo wod: note "Games Rx" as 155/225lbs for deadlifts. subs for rowing today are 400m run or 27 calories assault or echo bike.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell deadlifts 80% bodyweight total.  (  40/55lbs intermediate, 15/20lbs scaled).  Subs for box jumps are bench jumps, or to construct a box out of those aerobic step things  (10 risers plus top is 24", 8 risers+top=20").
