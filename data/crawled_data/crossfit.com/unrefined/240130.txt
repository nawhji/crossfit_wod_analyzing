Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a midline assault. The load of the front-rack walking lunges should be heavy but not unbearable ‚Äî it may be a grind, but aim to perform all sets unbroken. If you are not consistently on the GHD on a weekly basis, scale the range of motion and/or reps to the Intermediate rep scheme or fewer. If you are completing this workout as prescribed, each set of GHD sit-ups should be unbroken. Because both movements should be unbroken, your transition time can make or break your overall time.


Intermediate option:

For time:

10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 reps of:

Scaled to 135 lb, otherwise as rx‚Äôd.¬† 13:54.
135 was plenty on the walking lunges.¬† Those went okay; I could probably use more work here.¬† I had a failed rep in the set of 5 where I came down funny and couldn‚Äôt stand it up, but otherwise okay.¬† GHDs served to keep the heart rate up.¬† Didn‚Äôt see too much interference from all the hip flexor work.

time suck: my driveway is sloped so I had to turn around and go back to my starting position on the bigger sets so the bar wouldn‚Äôt roll away (and so I could drop it lol). Spinning around 185# got weird and ate away at my time a bit. Still proud of the effort.

Fell in the first round and had to rearrange things. Fell coming up from the last rep but kept going to finish. Those lunges we terrible and left me out of breath. I'm sure there were a few no-reps but I don't see a judge üòÖ

Felt good today doing it, had someone else start the time for me. Weird, the difference between front and back squat is at right now.
Let the knee hit the ground and touched the fround on the sit ups.

Welcome! I understood the lunge numbers to be total steps since that is how they are typically listed - in either distance or steps.

Somewhere between rx and intermediate:
used 105# for lunges - all sets unbroken 
ghd sit ups- full range of motion 
rep scheme - 10-1 for both movements 
finish time: 9:40 
in retrospect could have done Rx rep scheme for GHD sit ups as midline didn‚Äôt really get taxed

Broke briefly once each on sets of 16 and 14 GHDs, otherwise unbroken.  Midline is effectively worked over.

Globo wod: If a GHD machine isn't available sub situps on a medicine ball, exercise ball, or sitting perpendicular on a bench.  In all cases place your feet under heavy dumbbells.  Failing that sub incline board situps or weighted situps.  Again, if you don't do GHD situps often scale the reps and/or the range, or sub down to abmat situps.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell front rack lunges 55/80lbs (Intermediate 45/60, scaled 15/20lbs). Dumbbells are heavier than usual due to them resting on you in front rack.  If 50lb dumbbells are the max available today Rx men double the lunge reps, Rx women and Intermediate men add 2 reps to each lunge set.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Back in the Summer I ended up giving one of our soccer girls rhabdo after a workout with lunges; it was a classic Hadn't Been In For A While But Still Gave a Full Dose error on my part, and I wish I would have done a better job scaling for her. I will say, thought, that lunges are one of the most tricky things for me to scale in terms of volume because, like all forms of squats, it usually takes a lot of reps to build the loading order habit (load the hips, not knees) and a fault in that pattern seems to be more apparent in lunges than air squats or front squats. So there are 55 heavy lunges in today's workout, which probably equate to somewhere around 200 bodyweight ones. The question I'd ask myself when scaling is what is the most amount of reps a new person can do (so they can build the loading order habit) without getting completely wrecked? I obviously got that question wrong back in July, but I think this is where it helps to not be married to a particular rep scheme and look at when failure happens or the movement gets ugly; if they need to start using their hands to get up, or can't control their knees crashing to the floor on the descent, probably time to switch to something else like push-ups or plank hold.

I think it was Coach who said "let the trailing knee lightly kiss the ground"  or something to that effect.....

Thanks you guys. Thankfully she came back and finished the Summer out with us, and will hopefully be back this Summer.
Mike, the challenging part about "let trailing knee gently kiss the ground" is that is a very slow eccentric movement, and it seems eccentric-focused stuff gets (kb swing, lunge, ring row, hang snatch, GHD sit-up, pull-up) gets new people wrecked more then concentric-focused stuff.

100% on the eccentric loading leading to more DOMS/rhabdo.  Lunges are a big one - and the prescribed load today is not light.  It's a good reminder.

And now that I think about it, 110 GHDs is no small matter either...hence the Intermediate scaling

In my experience I've never had a case of anything more than sore for a new person doing high-rep GHDs, and that's probably because we cut the ROM bigtime. 1/4 range or 1/3 range at the most. Usually we'll go to L-sits as a sub, but sometimes I don't mind working on the timing of the actual movement
