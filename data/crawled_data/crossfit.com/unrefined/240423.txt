Scaling:

Fun fact: This is the most-programmed benchmark on CrossFit.com. Since 2001, this workout has been programmed 76 times. Today makes 77, and for good reason. If executed properly, this workout challenges the boundaries of human performance and requires no equipment. It's a fantastic test of stamina, endurance, and mental fortitude. Experienced athletes should try for a PR on this benchmark effort. Look back at your previous PR to help determine an appropriate pace. Newer athletes should reduce the distance to complete the run in no more than 20 minutes.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:


On a 20-minute clock for distance:

Run

Street running sounded too boring after all the weekend fun. I did a 7~8km trail run through the local woods. I had to stop a few times and reroute because of trail maintenance projects, probably logged 50min altogether? Far from a PR due to Regionals fatigue as well as the stops/starts.

Far off my PR.  Last logged 5k run was 22:49 in 2021 but I know I did at least a couple others since.  I just wanted to get it done today since the last time it was programmed I did a swim/run combo.  I just don't run distances like I did before my last lower back injury and it shows.

Globo wod: As rxed. If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.  Sub 6k row or 330 calories assault or echo bike if running isn't an option due to weather or other factors.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
How did last week's homework go? What workouts (or parts of workouts) did you feel were high up the CrossFit-specific ladder and which were not? Today, obviously, is one that is applicable to any outside-the-weight-room activity I can think of. So the question I would normally challenge you with is asking what your limiting factor is: legs or lungs? But I have a different one today, and one I was asking our people during Lynne earlier: do you actually 
want
 to pr? As the post says, this is the most programmed workout in CrossFit's history (probably thanks in large part to 2019 and early 2020), so all you vets probably know your time and are probably in the ballpark of being able to hit it. So will you?
Do a max set of something in the warmup: pull-ups, 115-lb. clean and jerks, handstand push-ups, sit-ups in 60 seconds, or whatever, and pay attention to your desire to complete another rep as you go on: I would assume it starts out high, and then as fatigue starts to kick in your desire to do another rep decreases - especially when you get close to the end of your capacity and your discomfort is at its peak. The reason I bring this up is because it's common for me to hear (in CrossFit, basketball, or track) that "I just didn't have it today" or "I'm not [blank] enough," but missed scores, tasks, workouts, or assignments can often be attributed to desire. The prerequisite for getting a pr on Helen is actually wanting to pr on Helen, and all the unpleasantness that comes with it. The more often you do these workouts, the smaller the prs are going to be. Eventually you won't be able to nutrition/technique/fit your way into a pr.
Let's put it another way: how would you rank this workout in terms of the old GENERAL FEAR LEVEL? Would you be willing to explore the option that in order to pr you might have to reconsider how hard you were trying before? If not, I'm not tripping so long as you sign the waiver saying that you will not get frustrated when prs stop coming on certain workouts (I signed one for Fight Gone Bad, Mel probably has for Barbara). 
But Chris, I swear I was tired after my last 5k
. No doubt you were! Chances are there is more, though, and it starts with being aware of your desire and want as the workout is going.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Do I want to go there today?
Do I want a repeatable course of something off-script and unknown?
Is my technique and attendance good enough to merit doing a single-modality workout?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
Run 200 meters
30 lunges (or less if needed)
15-sec L-sit

... and that's from a distance! My voice definitely gets stale for some of the athletes here at the Champions Club, and I need to work on when to shut the hell up and when to get in their heads. I feel like you have it today, though!

Brother, another great rant! Desire can have such a significant impact on performance.  I can comfortably say that today I had no desire to PR a 5k run - I have done so many already, and don't run single distances above 1 mile nearly as much anymore to try and reduce some wear on the lower back, to decide that a PR is not something 
I want
 right now.
To your homework question: I think QF3 was very much in the realm of CF specific, with some flavor of it in 240416.  Otherwise, they were a broad range of applicability in my opinion.
