Workout of the Day
69
5 rounds for time of:

6 wall walks

30 alternating single-leg squats


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a gymnastics couplet that falls in the moderate time domain. Expect the combination of being upside down, then squatting on one leg to be a bit disorienting. Remember to breathe, get your balance, and keep moving. Reduce the volume and movement complexity for wall walks to finish all reps in 2 minutes or less. As for the single-leg squats, reduce volume and change to alternating reverse lunges if needed to keep moving at a steady pace and finish in 2 minutes or less.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time of:


4
 wall walks


20
 alternating single-leg squats


Beginner option:

5 rounds for time of:


4 inchworm + push-ups from the knees


12 alternating reverse lunges


Coaching cues:

If you struggle with balance on the single-leg squat, lean slightly toward the leg you are squatting on and remember to keep the knee tracking in line with the toes.


Resources:


The Wall Walk


The Single-Leg Squat


Inchworm + Push-Up From the Knees


Reverse Lunge

DL x 5
115-145-195-215-235-255#
Then, scaled
5 RFT
4 Wall walks
30 Toenail squats, alternating
Somewhere between 15 to 20 minutes
Forgot to look at the clock until after I finished the first round, oops.  Tried some TRX assisted pistols and high box step downs, but remembered toenail squats and opted for that after a few reps - knees were not having pistols and it didn’t feel like step downs were going to do enough for the desired stimulus, but the toenails were a happy medium.

Worked in DLs too, nice job! I had not seen those squats before; had to look up & try a few. Good option to keep in mind!

Deadlift 5-5-5-5-5-5
245-255-265-265-255-245#
Any thought out there about shoulder presses with kettlebells?  My shoulders sore/hurting, not in a good way, after I did some yesterday. Certainly the weight distribution very different from SP with a barbell or DBs.

Hey Jim, kettlebells with their center of mass being behind you at the top of a press and in front you at the bottom; cause a lot of stress on your stabilizers that you may be experiencing harsh DOMS (muscle soreness) in. This can cause joint pain indirectly. Should be good in a few days. You didn’t you try today’s movements before deadlifting, did you? I ask because the beauty of CrossFit on the main site is that stress is evenly distributed over a large variety of movements. This can cause greater resilience.

This workout looks challenging but exciting! I like how it scales for different skill levels, making it accessible to everyone. The tips for balancing during single-leg squats are really helpful, and I appreciate the focus on proper form. Can't wait to give this a try and see how I do!
