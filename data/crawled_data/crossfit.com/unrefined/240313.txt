Scaling:

Today‚Äôs intervals are all-out sprints on the bike with a twist ‚Äî you will stand as you pedal. Expect this to add some spice to the workout. Use any stationary bike you have available (e.g., 
Echo bike
, Assault bike, airdyne bike). Each round should be maximal effort. This means each set should occupy every ounce of your capacity, both mental and physical. As long as you are pushing these physical and psychological tolerances then you are hitting this workout as intended. Following each set, rest 2 minutes before the next attempt.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:

5 rounds each for time:


600/750-meter
 standing bike

*Rest 2 minutes between efforts.

Rest (2:00)
Did this one as a lactic acid recovery conditioning. Did not really sweat or get HR up to high, but biking legs were heavy and full of acid from slow lift earlier. Thought the time was supposed to be around (1:00), but was really around (2:00). Oh well, missed that stimulus, but actually got on a bike. 
Just checked the box on getting on a bike.

hard to get the times from my workout log but I think these are fairly accurate. Also had to go off miles as my UOM. Either way a good dose and challenging.

Rx on an echo bike - 1:38, 2:14, 2:04, 2:15, 1:52
Agreed with others, output has a cliff edge. Also, felt like I was doing the ski mogul to avoid the arm paddles and hard to fully engage legs and arms buts stabilizing muscles were very engaged. It felt very inefficient. Which may also explain the cliff edge. Would like to understand the science behind it. Also for science, I redid the workout 5mins later and subbed standing for sitting. Times for context - 1:23, 1:22, 1:21, 1:19, 1:17

1000-meter bike: Echo bike was not setup properly for standing and didn‚Äôt want to reconfigure so I sprinted as hard a possible sitting.

stationary bike - mostly seated
1:38 - 1:42 for all 5 rounds
don't use the bike often but it was very awkward trying to sprint while standing so opted to sit & sprint vs stand and go slower

No bike, subbed 500m rows - should have subbed running
DNF!! Sprained fingers still hurt too much. Made 6 attempts at 500m, only completed #4; others were all halted around 300m~400m. Pacing was consistently near 1:54/500m.

Subbed 300m rows‚Ä¶after looking at the other results, I shoulda gone with a 350. 
1:10-1:09-1:08-1:08-1:08
25-27 strokes/min and 20-21 cals each effort. Still, a good  by pump (minus the balance thing out of saddle cycling brings)

I guess I‚Äôm dumb but I don‚Äôt understand the 800/1000m rds, is it an 800 m bike then 1000 m bike and that is considered one round or is it one or the other for five rounds?

800m for the ladies, 1000m for the gents for each of 5 rounds.  That is how I read it, and how loads are typically listed for movements.

Rx on a C2 bike Erg (resistance btwn 5 and 6)
1:42.7
1:49.8
1:51.8
1:51.3
1:48.8
I did the pose method practice in the video Chris S. shared, but as I got tired through each effort that heel lift, shift, fall rhythm started to fall apart.  I wanted to sit so bad in the second half each time.  Not surprised about any of this: Rx rest periods should instill fear because the intent is ALWAYS max effort for each work period whether or not it is stated.  I chose the C2 after practicing on a Hammer Strength echo/assault style bike because how close the handles got to my body while out of the saddle was just too awkward.

RX on Assault bike.

Total time: 16:02
That was just as nasty as I expected, and a little bit nastier. 
Sold my soul on the first round, paced the last four. Selling my soul only bought me 8 seconds; 8 seconds that would take an extra 60 to recover from. 
I feel that the stimulus I achieved was 99% of what they asked for. 
Glad to see this one in the rearview.

Smart move. The tremendous Colombian road cyclists in the 80s and 90s used to do that when training in the mountains.

Globo wod: If an echo, assault or Aerodyne bike isn't available sub the bike on any recumbent bike that reads meters (c2 bike included).  If it only reads calories its 20/25 calories. If no bike is available sub either 400/500m row or 350/500m runs on a treadmill.  Use a high incline if on a conventional treadmill.

Steve, maybe 20/25 is equivalent on an echo/assault, but on the C2 (and maybe other spin/recumbent) I would say somewhere around 35/40 as 40 was what I hit on my fastest time (resistance at 5-6) for the 1km.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Pose Method on the bike is just as much of a gamechanger as Pose Method is for running. Here's an 
old video
 (w/f safe) from Dr. Romanov (or, rather Severin) that shows a good drill to practice before riding. And really, this workout is a good chance to talk about "throwaway movements." Burpees, bike, box jump,... what else... maybe bear crawls? All those movements can be thrown into workouts as mindless conditioning but man, doing anything mindless in CrossFit better be few and far between, saved for the most extreme I Just Need To Get My Mind Off This Something days or before the Michigan-Ohio State game. The neurological adaptations that happen from squatting and handstands are probably just as important as the physical adaptations. I get to coach one of our moms with MS twice a week and it's just nuts how much we take our bodyweight perception for granted. Can you imagine what it would be like to not know if your foot is touching the ground? So when we get a chance practice shifting bodyweight in any manner, I think it's a good time to take advantage of it. Especially when there's literally nothing else to distract us during the workout. No barbell, no rings, no pull-up bar or dumbbells. Just you, the bike, and the bodyweight you feel from the pedals supporting your feet. Lift the back foot and allow yourself to fall slightly to the side, then do the same when you hit the pose again.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Do I really need a mindless conditioning thing or would I actually feel better getting my conditioning in as a byproduct of technique practice?
Is this speed/intensity what I need to practice right now or do I need to modify the distance to go faster or slower?
Am I willing to work intensely enough to deserve a 2-minute rest between rounds?

1-minute on, 2-minutes off is close. Biking off the saddle like this will drop off in pace after a few rounds.

Yeah, after doing this, I would say a closer equivalent is to use whatever your average 500m row sprint time is and maybe even add 10-15 seconds.
