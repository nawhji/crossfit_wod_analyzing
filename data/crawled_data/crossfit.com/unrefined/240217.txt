Scaling:

Today’s workout is a twist on the classic benchmark workout, Nancy. The weight starts heavy, but as the reps increase, the weight decreases. We’ll start with the barbell on the ground, which means you must be able to safely snatch it — reduce the load if this is not possible as written. The first barbell should be challenging, but you should be able to hold it overhead for an unbroken set. Some athletes may be able to go unbroken in the remaining sets — if you have to break, it should only be once. Keep the runs to 2:15 or less.

Worked up to a max snatch. Got underneath 145lbs. Don't have overhead stamina to rep out ohsquats at 135lbs. Gassed out of overheads. Just went for a quick EASY run after. No way I could have done this as an intervals workout as prescribed intermediate. Check the box on practing snatch, OverheadSquat, and getting some running in.

Unbroken OHS.  They went pretty well, left shoulder a little wonky.  Runs were not fast, but did try to focus on being light and breathing consistently.

Hot Damn! 
ngl… almost an hour to complete @RX
Notably: I did the WOD at Lifetime Fitness. Focused on quality of form rather than speed. Waited for my heart to be under 120 bpm after each run before doing OHS.

5min rest, then
240216, results there.
It was apparent in warmup that the left wrist wasn’t going to take much loading or volume at that angle of extension today, so I opted for using the beginner scale at a higher weight as sort of an extended warmup. Besides, I did a bunch of squats and running yesterday.

OHS (or snatches) are not one of my strengths …. I’m just happy to be able to do them in some capacity.

Globo wod:  subs for runs are 12 shuttle sprints down and back 25 feet, 500m row or 27 calories assault or echo bike.  For the OHS it comes down to availability of equipment and if you're doing this with bumper plates or iron plates.  If you're doing this WOD with iron plates pick 2 weights,  one heavier and one lighter, do the 5 and 10 heavy and remaining sets with the lighter weight. If you're using iron plates today it's OK to use a rack. Dumbbells sub dumbbell OHS 3-6-9-12-15 each arm. 3-6-9 with a heavier dumbbell and the remaining sets with a lighter dumbbell.   Keep in mind that dumbbell OHS are more difficult than barbell OHS when scaling.  Play with this and warm up to a heavy single dumbbell OHS,  and then do the first 3 sets at 80-90% that good rep on the weakest side, then the final 3 sets at 60% ish.  If the gyms busy I suggest the dumbbell option today.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Again, directed at the veterans. How many workouts have you practiced this week? How many workouts have you changed your mind mid-workout, lost count of reps or rounds, or deviated from the rx in order to serve a purpose. How often do you ask yourself if you are working out to get better at CrossFit or are you using CrossFit to make yourself better? Let's say you take this workout like you're trying for best overall time: What pace are you going to run the 400m? 1:45? Do you really need to practice 1:45 400's? You could probably do a 1:45 400 on a round of Manion. Let's say you're trying for best overall time: what weight are you scaling the OHS to? Do you really need to practice a set of 15, 10, or 5 overhead squats at a weight you know you can get? If those are the case, why not just do Nancy?
Running and overhead squats are arguably the most elegant things coupled together into CrossFit; each movement serves an incredible dose of humble on the other. Running a 400 at 70% speed and OHS at moderate load/speed/intensity will provide the best overall workout time, but would also miss an opportunity to really expose - and therefore make progress on - a weakness. There is no possible way you are an elite runner and elite overhead squatter. Those don't exist. Your overhead squats are your strength? Sprint the 400s and see how well your squatting form holds up to the worst race in track and field. Running is your thing? Make each squat set at a weight that you could not do one more rep than the prescribed amount and see how awkward your running looks. Turn the timer off, or start at an odd time to not be tempted to go back to 70% at each one. That would be an example of practicing a workout, and I would bet you would see a good translation next time Nancy comes up.
SCALING QUESTIONS
Have I done Nancy enough (and is my time good enough) to merit doing a variation of it?
Flexibility: Do I want to keep overhead squats and stay light or go to back squats with heavier weight and practice OHS in warmup?
Do I want to treat this thing like a test and go for best time or emphasize one or the other?
Also the rant.
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
5 rounds of:
1:00 overhead squat hold
Run 400m
Rest as needed between stations to keep form good
