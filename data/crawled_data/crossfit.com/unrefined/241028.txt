Scaling:

Today is a heavy lifting day. Remember that “heavy” is relative to each athlete's physical and psychological tolerances. In other words, heavy is going to be different for each athlete. Most athletes can complete this lifting day as prescribed. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.


Considering the heavy loading of the barbell, you are encouraged to find a spotter. However, if you are not able to find a spotter, use some type of guard rails or simply reduce the load to something you can manage without a spotter.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

Same as Rx’d.


Coaching cues:

Be sure your feet are firmly planted on the ground. This will enable you to drive through your heels and get the lower body involved in your lifts.
