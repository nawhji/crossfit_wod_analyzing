Scaling:

Today’s workout is a heavy sprint effort. The barbell gets lighter and reps decrease with each movement you complete. Both the deadlifts and the hang power cleans should feel moderately heavy while the front squats may be more on the moderate side. When choosing loads for the workout, the deadlift should be completed in 3 sets or less, the hang power cleans in 5 sets or less, and the front squats should be unbroken. Challenge yourself on this workout, but don’t make the weights so heavy that form is compromised.

Coaching cues:

In the hang power clean, focus on setting up with your shoulders over the barbell. Then, stand up by driving your heels into the ground, squeezing your thighs and glutes, and getting your shoulders behind the barbell. To finish getting under the barbell, drive your elbows through quickly, pull yourself into a partial squat, and receive the bar on the shoulders.
