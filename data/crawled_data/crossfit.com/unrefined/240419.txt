Scaling:

Welcome to the second workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! This leg- and lung-burner workout has a 20-minute cap. Those not recording a score for competition should scale accordingly to finish within this time. Advanced athletes should push for sub-13 minutes. Find a wall-ball shot load that allows for 10 or more reps at a time, and push the lateral burpee box jump-overs to get in 10 per minute. Scale as needed to hit these ranges. Those not competing in Quarterfinals should choose challenging variations that still allow for continuous movement. Consider taking short breaks during the wall-ball shots and burpees to help you keep moving throughout the workout. This one will be all about finding the line between pushing the pace and holding on for continuous movement.

Intermediate (only 14# MB available)
180 reps
Then did our Friday Bulletproof workout:
1 mile fartlek run to the sand court
30 minutes of Punishment Volleyball - every third point scored the other team has to do 5 burpees
1 mile fartlek run back
My team did 15 burpees, the other did 20.  
A bit of a fun day today, but man am I sick of burpees.  QF2 was evil, and it was definitely the lateral burp over BJ that slowed things down.

big old FU to whoever programmed this one. Let‚Äôs make burpees worse by laterally jumping every time! Great idea!

Globo wod: see yesterday's note on Semifinals if you are doing them for scores or as training for next year.  Subs are 15/20lb dumbbell thrusters for wall balls and burpees over a bench or object, or standard burpees to object (20/24" if possible).  BTW I hope this isn't 25.1...
