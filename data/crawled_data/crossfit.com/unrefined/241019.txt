Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a gymnastics couplet with ascending reps. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the first few rounds ‚Äî this workout will get spicy soon enough. To find the target for the burpees, extend your arms over your head and find a target about 6 inches above your fingertips. As for the GHD sit-ups, go into this workout with a number of reps appropriate for you. If you hit that number, finish the workout with just burpees. If you do not spend a lot of time on this piece of equipment, scale the number of reps and range of motion. The GHD is an amazing piece of equipment, but respect its power.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 12 minutes of:

3 burpees to a 6-inch target

2 GHD sit-ups 
to parallel

6 burpees to a 6-inch target

4 GHD sit-ups 
to parallel

9 burpees to a 6-inch target

6 GHD sit-ups 
to parallel

‚Ä¶ Continue to add 3 reps to the burpees and 2 reps to the GHD   sit-ups until time expires.


Beginner option:

Complete as many reps as possible in 
8
 minutes of:

3 
burpees

3 
sit-ups

6 
burpees

6 
sit-ups

9 
burpees

9 
sit-ups

‚Ä¶ Continue to add 3 reps to each exercise until time expires.


Coaching cues:

On the GHD sit-up, lower yourself down with bent legs and as soon as you reach the bottom of your rep, brace your midline and straighten the legs by squeezing your thighs and driving your heels toward the wall in front of you. This rapid extension of the legs helps incorporate bigger muscle groups and helps protect the lower back.

Rx* 18's + 21 Burps = 147 reps
(completed the 21 GHD after)
*Had to rig a BB and bench to do GHDs in my garage, went as full ROM as possible, and the target was around 7-8" vice 6.  I just don't cycle burpees that fast.
