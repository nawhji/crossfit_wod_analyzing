Scaling:

Today’s workout is a fun triplet in which you’ll move quickly through a descending ladder. Your goal is to finish this workout in 15 minutes or less. Move as fast as you can through the round of 30 while still remaining consistent in the 20s; this should feel fast, but not like a full sprint.


The load of the dumbbell should allow you to maintain sets of 10 or more fast reps at a time with no more than 10-15 seconds of rest between sets.


Complete the chest-to-bar pull-ups in sets of 5+ to start. If that can't be done for the round of 30, reduce the volume to 15-12-9 and maintain 3+ reps at a time, OR scale to chin-over-bar or jumping chest-to-bar pull-ups.


Aim for consistency through the burpees with 10+ reps/minute. If needed, scale the volume of the entire workout to 21-15-9 to stay within the intended time domain.


Intermediate option:

30-20-10 reps for time of:

(15:39)
30-20-10 Burpees (10+10+10,7+7+6,10)
15-12-9 PullUps (5+5+5,4+4+4,3+2+2+2)
30-20-10 KBSnatches
Did this after heavy squats and some lunges. Wanted to finish under 15:00, but I'll blame the awkward kbs on losing time. Didn't want to FarmerCarry dbs across college gym so I just used KB in boxroom. Burpees were tough but I'm improving my cycling.  Rested about :15 secs after each set. PullUps hit failure quick. Disappointed that I can't always just gut out 5 PullUps. Slight kips towards end. Flirted with redlining, but was pretty gassed afterwards.

I was unsure how to do this so I did burpees, pull-ups and snatches each for 30-20-10.
42 YOF - 200 lbs 
25 lbs on snatches
For pull-ups I can only pull up maybe an inch or two
Got done in 42:03

Steady pace on the burps, broke once each on the 30 and 20 DBS, and broke multiple times on pull-ups (still the limiting factor).  The engine just wasn't really there today for a 10 minute effort.

As rx'd, 15:20.
C2B pull-ups were the limiting factor.  Started in sets of 5, but switched to sets of 3 after the first 10.  Straight through on burpees and snatches.  Round of 30 in about 7.5 minutes, so happy to keep about the same pace on the back half of this.

should have reduced the reps on the C2B. Cannot string together kipping ones, they all need a reset at the bottom. Grip was fucking destroyed by the time I grabbed the dumbbell each round!

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I'd like to challenge the picture that's posted with this workout - which is a thin line to walk as I'm sure both athletes are stronger than I am, so hopefully this is in good taste. Just ask yourself what is the context of the dumbbell snatches in this picture? Is this the end of the workout where the grip is fried chicken and every bit of arm muscle is needed to finish the rep? Are these two rivals who aren't confident in their technique so they rush through the movement hoping to beat the other in the workout? Do they not have the technique ingrained in the first place and are just allowing this to be a "anything goes workout" as fast as possible? Are they just being asked to focus on the start position (flat back) and finish position (overhead with external rotation) and not worry about the middle? (Am I tripping and they're actually on the way down?) Then ask yourself, what good reasons are there to practice a dumbbell snatch while pulling the arms early?  Think on that for a minute. There are certainly some occasions where it wouldn't be terrible to overlook that fault, just know it's got a limited shelf life within that movement, itself, and limited applicability to others. If the technique isn't there and you still want intensity, push press or kb swing might be simpler options while you practice db snatch in the warmup.
FORMAT/MOVEMENT QUESTIONS
Coast the burpees a bit to go for best overall time or sprint that first set and live with whatever happens?
See rant.

Dude, I'm not sure they're on the way up or down, but I'm glad you pointed it out - made me really think about my execution, thanks!
