Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout will test your grip and climbing technique. If you rely a lot on your arms during the rope climb, you will find yourself waiting for your grip to recover. However, if you focus on a secure foot hold and staying close to the rope, you will be able to keep moving and post a fast time. Choose a toes-to-bar option that allows you to complete the reps in 2 sets or less. As for the dumbbell snatches, the load should be light to moderate and allow you to get through 20 reps in 2 sets or less. If you can go unbroken, do it.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time of:

1 rope climb to 
12 feet

10 
knees-to-chests

1 rope climb to 
12 feet

20 alternating dumbbell snatches


‚ôÄ 
20
 lb

‚ôÇ 
35
 lb


Beginner option:

5 rounds for time of:


2 pull-to-stands


5 hanging knee raises


2 pull-to-stands


10
 alternating dumbbell snatches


‚ôÄ 
10
 lb

‚ôÇ 
15
 lb


Coaching cues:

Before standing up on your foot hold, make sure it is secure. In other words, make sure to pull the rope tight to the foot and take out any slack. Pinch the feet together, secure the hook, and then stand up. Over time, this process gets faster, but you must develop good habits at slower speeds first. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

17:39 RIP, my grip.
13 x 12ft (156) instead of 10 x 15ft.
Did +1 rope climb to 12ft in rds 1-3
Honestly, this Wod was absolutely amazing! I just love a good grip workout. Also, the programmers are doing such an amazing job at modulating intensity recently.
