Kavan Majidi — Fighting To Become a Judo Olympian With CrossFit


“My biggest fear is (to) say, ‘I wish I did it.'” – Kavan Majidi


Except for a few special Judo training camps, CrossFit was Majidi's only method of training to prepare for Judo. After earning a spot on the International Judo Federation’s Refugee Team, he became an IOC Refugee Athlete Scholarship holder and hopes to represent the Refugee Olympic Team in Paris 2024.

Does anyone know how to open comments/results from older 'compare to's' like from 2014, I find that I can't access those anymore when they come up, they either just show a '...' or the page is blank.
