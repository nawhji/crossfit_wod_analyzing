PushJerk 5-5-5-4-3-3
Did this one as a semi-slow lift. Probs could've rested the jerks :30 more. StrictPress was good and hit 1RM. PushPress was true, only used calfs to help press; didn't jerk under like habit. Jerks were tiring. Form was dropping in latter sets, so I cut sets early then dropped weight. I'll count 175lbs as my 5RM jerk. Good Lift. 
Wonder if I could jerk 205lbs?

Haven't jerked heavy in a long time. Heavy endurance was not there. Rested little more than 2min a set. More rest next time. Baseline strength noted, but not near max. Oh well.

Minimum 5 reps with varying weights for each lift
SP heaviest 105#
PP heaviest 115#
Only 1 set at 95# for PJ - right elbow wasn‚Äôt doing so hot in the catch so I didn‚Äôt want to push the envelope. Besides, I scaled this back with the intent of doing some work in the lifts without causing pain in the elbows.

Rest as needed to allow effort. You are going for your heaviest single on the press, heaviest 3 on the push press and heaviest set of 5 on the push jerk. 
It isn‚Äôt a timed thing. Each set is unique.

Globo wod: If you are using iron plates today use weights that you can bring down under control.  Consider setting up the safeties in the rack below shoulder height if you need it.  You can also do sets across at the same weight for the push presses and push jerks after warm ups. Dumbbells sub is the same, however if you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets with good technique.
