Workout of the Day
67
3 rounds for time of:

400/500-meter row

120 double-unders

40 GHD hip extensions


Post times to comments.


Scaling:

The name of the game in today’s workout is consistency — be smooth on the rower, in control on the double-unders, and knock out bigger chunks of reps on the GHD. All athletes should aim to keep this workout under 20 minutes. More advanced athletes are challenged to go 15 minutes or less. If you are not accustomed to the GHD, look to reduce reps and range of motion. Athletes who are working on their double-unders should spend no more than 2 minutes working with the jump rope in each round.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time of:

400/500-meter row


2 minutes
 of double-under 
attempts


25
 GHD hip extensions


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time of:


200/250
-meter row


60 single
-unders


20 good mornings (PVC or empty barbell)


Coaching cues:

Imagine a string between your sternum and your belly button. If those two landmarks stay far away from each other, the string stays tight. When those two landmarks get closer together, the string is loose. During the GHD hip extensions, keep the string tight.

No rower, sub for air bike calories. 2:00/round of DUB attempts with at least that many jumps. Hip Extensions as Rx. No warm up, in a time pinch

18:28
Rows were 1:48, 1:48, 1:46, and DUs accumulated in each 2 minute period were 27, 40, 48 - yeah, not good at those.  Did 240 singles after just to see if I would have been able to get that done in less than 2 minutes, and it was less as expected.  There's a solid 1 to 1.5 minutes of extra transition time in there due to distance between the rower and GHD.  I asked staff if I could move 1 of the 10 rowers not being used closer to the GHD with the promise of returning it and was met with a resounding 'absolutely not'. Oh well, nothing to do but press on.

Great work on those DUs though still! I had some transition issues too, but last time I tried to move my rower I dinged the ceiling, so I gave myself a stern negative on that, like your gym staff😂

Globo wod:  if a rower isnt available sub 400m runs or 22/28 calories assault or echo bike.   If you are using a conventional treadmill for run sub use a slight incline.  If a GHD isnt available use a Roman Chair or back extension appratus for hip extensions or do supermans on the ground.   If you dont have a speed rope do side to side hops or tuck jumps.
