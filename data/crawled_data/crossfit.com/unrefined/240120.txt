Scaling:

Today's workout is a longer effort that combines monostructural rowing efforts while building to a heavy set of push jerks. The rows should take no longer than 5:30, with faster rowers coming in closer to 3:30. Choose push jerk loads that allow you to complete each round of decreasing reps at increasing loads in no more than 3 sets and in under 2 minutes.

Did this one untimed on accident. Went moderately hard on the pulls but not hard and not near redline. Just took today as some volume rowing.

def couldn't do the Rx weight if the goal was to not break into more than 3 sets so I scaled it down. Intermediate option seemed too low, so I just picked weight that I thought would be challenging enough. Rower is busted and doesn't count cals so I just did for time:
2:30 row
21 reps @ 75
2:30 row
15 reps @ 95
2:30 row
9 reps @ 115 
15:59 total

Shoulders a bit tight for this one made the heavy jerks tough. Jerk from rack but ditched twice to the floor at 225lbs which extended the time quite a bit to clean and jerk. Great fun workout though

Scaled to women‚Äôs Rx (both calories and loads), 16:38.
Pretty consistent pace on the rows, around 1:55 pace, a bit slower on the last one.¬† Jerks from the floor, 3 separate bars, unbroken reps.¬† Tough but fun.

Rows took about 3min each round. PJs from the rack were in 2 sets for the first 2 rounds. Entered the last set of PJs at 14:11...then it took the remainder of the time to complete at 225lbs.

I thought the same thing Chris--is this is a new thing?  I looked back in past wods and I can't find anything the has a men's/women's difference for row or bike.  Is this only because it's an "erg"??

Used mens RX cals on the rower and womens RX weights for the barbell. Modified to a push press since my cycling on the jerk needs work. Held each row right around 5:30 (2:12.7 pace), next time out I would try to go a few beats faster.

Globo wod: If you don't have a rower sub 45/60 calories assault or echo bike,  or 500m runs.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell push jerks (women 35/45/55lbs, men 50/65/80 lbs).   If you don't have heavy dumbbells for those sets sub kipping handstand pushups, with the final set at a deficit.   Intermediate 20/30/40, 35/45/50lb dumbbells.

Chris, assuming you ask a serious question: if Jeff and Laura raced to 75 calories, who would win? And at what count would the 2nd place finisher be? Does HQ providing approximate time frames for todays rowing portion not suggest relative intensity to say "Rx?"
Second time in a few weeks you've spoken up on  HQ providing Guys/Gals Rx. Wondering what your suggestion might be.

Hey John, it was a serious question, I'm sure both of us know plenty of fit Lauras who would beat plenty of fit Jeffs in a race for 75 calories. I would say the second place finisher would have a count for whatever they were at, make note of it, and try to close the gap next time. I believe it suggests relative intensity to say rx for sure; I guess I'm asking what's the rationale behind doing it for this workout and not doing it for Jackie or Helen or a 5k run? 
And I catch myself being snarky with comments sometimes, so I can understand this one coming off that way - especially with my history. I definitely miss Coach's presence on the main site and I also have a bias towards certain time frames in CrossFit's history (2005-2008, 2019-2020). I try and not let that bias interfere with looking for best practices, and in this case I'm truly asking to hear why HQ believes having guys and girls distances/efforts is best practices. Based on my bias and also from what I hear/see from some girls (teens and moms) at my gym, I don't think it's best practice. I am definitely open to being wrong, though.

I should add, I'm assuming the target audience for these workouts is the Lauras who can beat the Jeffs. If that's not the case then I'm wrong for sure.

Did a scaled version of the workout with a 60 cal row and a weight of 40kg (21)/40kg (15)/50kg (9).
Finished in 40:21.46
Rows were done within the 5:30 time cap but I guess I underestimated the time it took to do the push jerks.
Kept the push jerks to sets of 3 each round (7/5/3)

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I have a difficult time seeing the logic behind different monostructural prescriptions for guys and girls. Anyone want to help me out there?
MAIN DECISION
Do I want to emphasize either the strength or monostructural piece, or just go for best overall time?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM
													x
HEAVY
STRENGTH SCALE
Max effort push jerk, then hit a hard 2k row for time
INTENSITY SCALE
Rest as needed in between each station, go as hard as you can.
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
Row
Push jerk (empty bar)
*pick your reps/distance for each, ideally the most you can do in one set without your form breaking down
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 7?

I thought the same thing Chris--is this is a new thing?  I looked back in past wods and I can't find anything the has a men's/women's difference for row or bike.  Is this only because it's an "erg"??
