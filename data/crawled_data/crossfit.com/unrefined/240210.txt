Scaling:

Today we have a longer chipper-style workout. Expect the kettlebell swings and knees-to-elbows to play off of each other in an interesting way. Use a kettlebell that allows you to perform each section in 2 sets or less. You should always be able to complete at least 5 knees-to-elbows throughout the workout. Aim to complete each run in 5 minutes or less. Work hard and have fun today.

Did not want to do this one. Tired after work and treadmill running sucks. Back blew up early. Runs weren't too bad, still got great conditioning, but weak with running impact. Grip was slippery on the hangs. KB Swings and hangs were all filler no killer. This was just a chipper with some half mile tempo intervals.

Hello! 
M19/163lbs/5‚Äô10
Route: Intermediate Option
Did running on treadmill, and did 30 lb swings due to that being the highest the gym had.
Time:  19:20
Intensity: 9/10
Comments:
I actually did like this one, felt like a good running workout. One of my favorites thus far.

First did yesterday‚Äôs couplet, results there, then after about 4 min rest I did:
For time
30 KBS (35# DB)
30 Hanging knee raises
400m run
20 KBS
20 HKR
400m run
10 KBS
10 HKR
400m run
11:06
I scaled that far because: 1) I did all of those movements yesterday as part of our Bulletproof workout; and 2) my knees were already feeling rough along with doing yesterday‚Äôs WOD first.

Globo wod: If you don't have a kettlebell sub dumbbell swings 35/50lb dumbbell for the kettlebell swings. Subs for runs are 55 calories assault or echo bike,  1k row, or 50 burpees.   If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.
