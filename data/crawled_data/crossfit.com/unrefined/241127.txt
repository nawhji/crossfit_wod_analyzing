Scaling:

Today’s workout is a heavy-lifting day. Most athletes will be able to do this workout as prescribed. This progression of snatch variations should prepare you well for the attempts at a 1-rep-max squat snatch. Those who aren’t yet ready to build to maximal loads can stay at light-to-moderate loading to practice dialing in consistent mechanics.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

Same as Rx’d.


Coaching cues:

In the third pull, imagine you are zipping up a jacket with the barbell. This will help keep the barbell close to your body as you finish the lift.

Never snatched before. Warmed up with dowel rod, practised the movements, then used a 15kg barbell.
Switched to 20kg barbell. Did three more warm up movement sets with microplates either side. 
Finally worked way up to approx. 30-35kg range. Snatch is really not my movement.

Just did a bunch of reps of each at each weight, all reps touch and go.
65-75-85-95#
Today was not going to be a max effort day - too many parts of that equation I care to list. Took the opportunity to work on hook grip some more.

"Heavy lifting day" & snatches don't jive in Favo world & I'm cool with that.  Practiced a few cycles of each move with a 15# body bar as warm up then:
Modified 24.1 to:
21 single arm DB snatch-right
21 lateral burpees over DB
21 single arm DB snatch-left
Same as above for 15, then 9
30# DB
