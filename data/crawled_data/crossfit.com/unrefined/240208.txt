I got off schedule due to feeling under the weather for a few days. Today I did clean and jerks as a means of getting back into form and practice (squat cleans and push jerk). 2 sets of 5 with 85#, 3 sets of 3 with 115#, 5 sets of 1 with 135#. Yesterday I did a very un-Crossfit workout of chest - db bench presses, bar dips and cable fly.
What's the beef with Ezekiel Emanuel? His perspective on aging?

Retested that 12/15 calorie per minute workout I bricked back in January.
12 calorie row, all 20 minutes.
And to hell with Ezekiel Emanuel.
