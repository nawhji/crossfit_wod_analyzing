Prescribing CrossFit


A comprehensive approach to health, where physicians prescribe medications and actively promote diet and exercise, particularly through CrossFit, is essential. Dr. Shveta Raju and Dr. Dinesh Raju, both CrossFit-certified physicians, highlight how their training in the CrossFit methodology helps them guide patients toward better health by incorporating weight training, high-intensity circuits, and functional movements into their lives. They contrast CrossFit's unique, varied, and scalable training with other fitness programs, stressing its effectiveness in improving physical and mental health. As advocates of CrossFit, they aim to extend this model to more patients, fostering both individual and community health improvements.
