Scaling:

Today’s workout has a moderate time domain and comprises a single round with decreasing reps and distances. With your midline being a major factor in this workout, expect the GHD sit-ups to interfere with your rope climbs and runs. Advanced athletes should push the pace on the runs and try to go unbroken on the GHD sit-ups. Less-experienced athletes should pace the runs to set themselves up for success with the sit-ups and rope climbs.

M/33/218lbs/5'7"
~(18:00)
PullUps 15,10,5
ABSitUps 20,15,10
0.5 (6.1mph), 0.25(6.9mph), 0.25Miles(7.2mph)
Did this one as just a quick pull-up and run. PullUps were sets of 5. First 15 were the hardes. ABSitUps were filler, probs should of programmed double, but did not want to cramp. Run was smooth, but quick hard tempo. 
This was the first time ina long while, (maybe years), that I've done back to back running days that were not easy runs. Cant remember last time I ran two days in a row. Tried to do Randy after, but it just wasn't there. Gas tank wasn't empty but felt like engine had no more oil. Hip/pubic bone feels tweaked in the bones. Hopefully a rest day will cure all.

completed 4.11 post Randy (bad idea). Intermediate-like with all the equipment subs. incline for situps for GHD, x3 PU + K2E for each rope climb, 0.5 mile spin bike for each run (every round).
15:30
had less gas than anticipated after Randy and this turned into a box checker.

Rx’d:  16:46
Took about 15 seconds between each rope climb to conserve grip, rather than fatigue and fall. I have an access cut in my garage ceiling to get to 15’, so it would suck to catch my shoulder on the edge if I fell. My rope is a line from my old ship, so not grip-friendly. Gotta get a better rope. Notwithstanding, rope climbs went better than expected.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead.
3 person Team event - For time
300 Squats - I did 100 (w/ 20# plate carrier)
150 Pull-ups - I did 50
120 Burpees - I did 40 (w/ 20# PC)
100 KB Swings - I did 34 (53# KB w/ 20# PC)
75 Deadlifts - I did 25 (135# w/ 20# PC)
Three .62 mile runs - I did 1 lap (w/ 20# PC)
3km row - I did 1km
41:42 for the team to finish
The team needs to accumulate the total reps and distances. Only 2 can work at a time, the third rests in a plank position.  Super fun and tiring.

45min could have gone way faster, but felt nauseous from the change in orientation doing the GHDs (a problem I also have with normal sit-ups to a lesser extent
my rope has 10 ft, so I did 6/4/3 seated rope climbs to get 130 total feet + the extra length from change to seated.

yeah, that's true. I was also wondering whether jumping up to catch the rope (like you often see athletes do in the games) would be allowed or not. But since I had to take long breaks after GHDs to let my sense of orientation recover anyway, I just did a maximum effort on the rope climbs

Substitutions: 
40, 30, 20 v-ups instead of GHD sit-ups.
800, 400, 200m air bike instead of running.
RPE: 13
After the workout I realized that air bike and v-ups have to be substituted with modification to the load. Had I done this wod as prescribed it would have been a lot tougher and taken a lot longer.

Globo wod: subs for rope climbs are 6 towel pullups per 1 legless rope climb or 3 per regular rope climb.  GHD subs are roman chair situps,  situps sitting on on a bench perpendicular to it with your feet under heavy dumbbells, touching the ground behind you(a bosu ball or medicine ball can also be used), high incline situps, weighted abmat situps or 2 to 1 abmat situps.  Beware here, scale or substitute if you don't do GHD situps often, Uncle Rhabdo isn't to be messed with.  Subs for runs are 20/10/5 25ft down and back shuttles, 1000/500/250m row or 55/27/14 calories assault or echo bike.  If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.
