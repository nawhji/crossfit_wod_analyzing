Scaling:

Today’s workout is a repeat from a previous CrossFit Open. If you have completed this workout before, look back and try to beat your score. There are two ways to attack: If you are capable of performing the workout as prescribed, but the volume in each round is going to keep you from moving quickly, perform the workout as prescribed and see how far you can get. Alternatively, scale the movements so you can push yourself to complete at least 2 rounds.
