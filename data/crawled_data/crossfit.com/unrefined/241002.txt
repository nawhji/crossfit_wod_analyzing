Workout of the Day
104
For time:

800-meter run

25 kipping pull-ups

800-meter run

25 strict pull-ups

800-meter run

25 weighted pull-ups


♀ 20 lb

♂ 35 lb


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a longer endurance- and stamina-based effort. The run distance stays the same and the difficulty of the pull-up increases. For athletes who are capable of performing the variety of these pull-ups but not the volume, consider adjusting the reps to no less than 15 and adjusting the load of the dumbbell to accommodate your capacity. If you can not perform a particular pull-up in this workout, scale to a challenging variation based on the suggestions below. Aim to keep the run efforts to around 5 minutes or less. The weighted pull-ups will take the most time; however, these should not take more than 5 minutes to complete.


Modification suggestions:

Kipping pull-ups - Reduce reps, jumping pull-ups

Strict pull-ups - Reduce reps, banded pull-ups, ring rows

Weighted pull-ups - Reduce reps, reduce load, banded pull-ups,   ring rows

As rx'd, 21:40.
Did not relax but also did not push 100%.  Kept all runs under 4:00.  Unbroken kipping pull-ups; broke strict into sets of 5.  Weighted, did 10-5-5 with 36# weight vest.

Runs were way too slow, pull-ups too broken, not much gas in the tank this evening.  Simple and tough, gonna be sore after these last few days.

Globo wod: if you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline. Subs for runs are 50/60 calories assault or echo bike,  or 1000m row.  If your bar is not condicive to kipping do 15 strict to 15 L-sit to 15 weighted pullups,  runs between each. If its busy and someone may steal all the pullup bars do this as interval work as gym flow dictates.
