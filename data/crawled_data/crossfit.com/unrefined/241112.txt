Post times to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a gymnastics endurance and stamina tester. Expect both the muscle-ups and the handstand walk to not play nicely with one another. With that in mind, consider your strategy for this workout. Do you go unbroken on the muscle-ups? If you do, do you have the pressing stamina to kick right up and start your handstand walk? Or are you better off breaking up your muscle-ups to preserve more gas in the tank for the handstand walk? These are questions you need to consider. Take fatigue into consideration. If you need an extra break before kicking up into a handstand or jumping up on the rings, do it. You know your body best.


Intermediate option:

For time:


9
 ring muscle-ups


60-second
 handstand walk for 
distance


6
 ring muscle-ups


90-second
 handstand walk for 
distance


883 ring muscle-ups


120-second
 handstand walk for 
distance


Beginner option:

For time:


9 low-ring
 muscle-up 
transitions

50-foot 
bear crawl


6 low-ring
 muscle-up 
transitions

100-foot 
bear crawl


3 low-ring
 muscle-up 
transitions

150-foot 
bear crawl


Coaching cues:

Delay the transition a little longer than you want to. This means letting your hips and momentum in the swing carry you as high as possible before transitioning to the bottom of the dip. This will help you last longer and maybe help you get a few extra reps.

Attempted Rx but began failing MUs in the first round so I dropped a few reps off each round (12,9,6). However I did stick to the full HS walks no matter how long it took (150' took 5:30).

Thanks Favo, for the walk out/in reminder.  Not much energy and not very motivated today, but still had to get in some work.  Thanks for not programming any legs today HQ!

Great job! Ah, yes the WO/WI(s) were due to legs having no part of bear crawls today! Kudos for working those in too!

898 ring muscle ups on the intermediate option seems a bit like targeting or discrimination to the intermediate class today. Please fix this typo Thanks.

Beginner option:
For time:
9 low-ring muscle-up transitions
50-foot bear crawl
6 low-ring muscle-up transitions
100-foot bear crawl
3 low-ring muscle-up transitions
100-foot bear crawl
I had to get work gloves in between sets since I didn't think the concrete would tear my hands up so much on the bear crawls. Broke up the low-ring muscle-up transitions into sets of three. Didn't think I would get gassed out so much from the bear crawls. I forgot the last set was supposed to be 150-feet.

No where to hang rings so had to sub jumping transitions. 
Handstandwalks in 25ft segments. Each segment was unbroken.
