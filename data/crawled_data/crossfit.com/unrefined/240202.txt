Canadian Army Master Corporal Erin Doyle, 32, was killed in a firefight Aug. 11, 2008, in the Panjwaii District, Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. He is survived by his wife Nicole and his daughter Zarine.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a Hero. Compared to other Hero WODs, this is quick and should not be drawn out into a long slog. To keep moving, reduce the weight and reps on the split cleans. Modify the pull-ups so each round can be completed in 3 or 4 sets.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time of:


12
 dumbbell split cleans


15
 pull-ups


♀ 20-lb dumbbells


♂ 35-lb dumbbells


Beginner option:


4
 rounds for time of:


10
 dumbbell split cleans


12 ring rows


♀ 15-lb dumbbells


♂ 20-lb dumbbells


Resources:


The Kipping Pull-Up

RX. 22:50. AVG HR-150bpm. 
Went out way too hot. Unbroken SQ…. Mistake. 3r of 7pu was on point for most of the work. Round 2-5 broke up the SQ into 1x7, 1x8. That was money.

I’ve never done DB splits before. I went to the ground each time. The movement felt like a sloppy cheat rep. or something.

20 Deadlift 225# (275#)
400m run
20 KB Swing 32kg/2 pood KB
400m run
20 Overhead Squat 95# (115#)
400m run
20 Burpees
400m run
20 Pull-ups (CTB)
400m run
20 Box Jumps 24”
400m run
20 DB Squat Clean 45# DBs
400m run
29:13
That was a grind but tried to just keep moving. The number of reps per movement are deceiving - individually you'd think to yourself "oh that's not so bad", but taken as a whole it's a rough go.  Still feeling it my midline from that front rack walking lunge and GHD sit-up workout.

Chris--quite the rant--took up some of my warm up time:)
Very appropriate for me today-my 14 yr old son and I go to bjj once a week-
While rolling, there were some tears just under the surface for him (things that a dad can just tell) 
because he was having a difficult time---I just said take a quick breath, re-focus, and get back to it.
I want to "add a healthy dose of fear" for both of us.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Quick aside, I remember doing this when it first came out and was convinced I'd never be able to feel my forearms again. Anyway, the 20-year anniversary CrossFit Journal article this time around is 
Macroclimbing
, and in my opinion it's the second-most underrated article from the first generation (What About Recovery being #1). There is so much great insight on the importance of hanging, swinging, unstructured/informal movement, and play, and also the benefit of getting to know local businesses on a personal basis, but maaaaaannn I miss a CrossFit that was willing to talk like this:
On average, the Bachar ladder is a huge hit with our crew. The ladders are going to serve as a powerful incentive to good nutrition; the fat boys are less than thrilled.
Also, I'd like to talk about football for a minute. And not my lizard-brain addiction to college football, but my experience playing football. My mom and dad made me play starting in 5th grade and I played all the way through my senior year in high school (save for 7th and 9th grade due to concussions). I was the quarterback all through my career - which meant I got to sit out of a lot of hitting drills in practice, but still got absolutely hamblasted in games. There were many things I liked about football, the most prominent of which was it toughened me up for basketball; I noticed significant improvements as a defender and rebounder coming out of football seasons, and noticed a lack of it in the two seasons where I didn't play football before. That first practice with pads was a rude wake-up call to 9 months of non-violence, but as the season went on I just became more and more accustomed to the contact.
I'm saying all of that to lead into my second favorite part of Macroclimbing:
Requiring the ladder climbers to traverse the cargo net at ladder’s top and cross each other on the net to descend on the opposite rope is fun to watch through your fingers. Allowing competitors physical contact on the traverse is in the cards. We’ll not go into the ideas for games that have been tabled and shelved since installing the climbing network. More than a few ideas involve throwing medicine balls at climbers.
So... yeah. I promise I get it. As most of you know I own my own affiliate, and it is literally the only thing I have; no degree, no side-jobs, just the gym. I know what it's like to watch Wesley fall from the pull-up bar or Mama V slide down from the rope too fast. So why on earth would I encourage 
more
 danger than we are already exposed to as the price to be paid for having not sat on our ass? Well, one of the things I value the most about a person is toughness, and while not everyone has to be a rugby player like Evan to be in the Champions Club, you can't be soft. Are we going to throw a medicine ball at you while you do pull-ups? No, we are not. Is it likely someone is going to give you a friendly shove during floor hockey or bear crawls back on the turf? Absolutely! Am I going to make everyone climb to the tall pull-up bars on the garage door like the babies at the gym? No, I am not. Am I going to insist everyone hang or do pull-ups on a high bar every now and then? Absolutely.
I think it's important to add a healthy dose of fear and contact to the CrossFit routine. That can be Mrs. Gloria climbing a snow mound at 81 years old or Mr. Curtis doing a handstand rollout or going to the park and playing "touch" football or doing handstand wars against the wall.
