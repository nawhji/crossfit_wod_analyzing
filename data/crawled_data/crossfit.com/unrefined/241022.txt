Workout of the Day

For time:

1,600-meter run

100 GHD hip extensions

Accumulate 2 minutes in a freestanding handstand hold


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout will look different for different ability levels. While an advanced athlete may be able to ‚Äúsprint‚Äù through, for other athletes, this may be more of a skill day ‚Äî an opportunity to practice new skills or push the margins of experience out a bit further. Choose an option for the run that allows you to finish in 10 minutes or less. If you do not spend a lot of time on the GHD, scale the number of reps and range of motion. If you do not have access to a GHD, consider performing good mornings either unloaded or at most with an empty barbell. When it comes to the freestanding handstand hold, choose an option that allows you to hold for at least 15 seconds. That said, if you want to try the freestanding handstand, but you can only hold for a few seconds at a time, simply scale the time you accumulate. Have fun with this one and step outside your comfort zone.


Intermediate option:

For time:

1,600-meter run


70
 GHD hip extensions

Accumulate 2 minutes in a handstand hold 
against the wall


Beginner option:

For time:


800
-meter run


50 good mornings, unloaded

Accumulate 
1
 minute in a 
plank hold


Coaching cues:

As you find a balance point when you are upside-down, draw an imaginary line between your thumbs. This is a great place to keep your gaze.

SCALING
‚Ää
This classic benchmark contains a high volume of a light weightlifting movement. Choose a load that allows you to hang on for large sets. Consider strategic breaks as a way to keep yourself moving and avoid longer periods of hook gripping your shorts. Remember, one more rep is one rep closer to finishing the workout. Be sure to look back at your previous score to help you better understand your strategy for today‚Äôs effort.

Completed post 10/21 at the Y. Intermediate. Treadmill run, 45 degree back extensions x70, HS against wall. 
17:04
run in 7:30
extensions broken into sets of 10 (recently hurt my lower back and it is just feeling better)
handstand holds in 3 sets. Definitely more of a practice than a push.

Wanted to run outside which likely lost me time getting out of the basement and around the neighborhood/cars (8:15). GHD hip extensions in small sets for most of the ~3:40. Wall-facing HS holds, trying to stay stacked and put minimal pressure on the wall. This caused me to keep falling over ...

Most of the handstand was against the wall. Couldn‚Äôt do more than a few seconds of freestanding handstands without falling. Accumulated about :15 free, then shifted to the wall.

Globo wod:  if you are using a convential treadmill use a slight incline. subs for running are 2000m row or 100/120 cal assault or echo bike.  If you don't have a GHD sub either extensions on a roman chair or similar appratus or 150 supermans om the ground. For handstand hold if your globo prohibits these accumulate 4 minutes of holding 2 dumbbells locked out overhead at 60-75% bodyweight total combined weight of the dumbbells.

SCALING
‚Ää
Today‚Äôs workout will look different for different ability levels. While an advanced athlete may be able to ‚Äúsprint‚Äù through, for other athletes, this may be more of a skill day ‚Äî an opportunity to practice new skills or push the margins of experience out a bit further. Choose an option for the run that allows you to finish in 10 minutes or less. If you do not spend a lot of time on the GHD, scale the number of reps and range of motion. If you do not have access to a GHD, consider performing good mornings either unloaded or at most with an empty barbell. When it comes to the freestanding handstand hold, choose an option that allows you to hold for at least 15 seconds. That said, if you want to try the freestanding handstand, but you can only hold for a few seconds at a time, simply scale the time you accumulate. Have fun with this one and step outside your comfort zone.
