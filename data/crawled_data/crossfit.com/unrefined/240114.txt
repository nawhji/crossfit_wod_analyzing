Done earlier today utilizing some outdoor runs at the home gym. Rxd. Opted for single KB overhead lunges. 10 lunges. Stop. Change arm. 10 lunges. American swings, 45-15. 
16:33. 
pretty much all of it was tough in this weather. Legs feel cooked now, hoping for some strict presses tomorrow!
thanks for the help on the lunge question Jonathan and Lincoln!

It was too cold to run outside and I only had access to a 25 lb kettlebell, so I had to scale the workout a bit. 
My modifications:

60 KB swings (25 lb)
24 assault bike calories
60 KB alternating lunges (25 lb)

Legs might be a little Jell-O at the beginning of the second 800m...ha, ha, that was an understatement.  Wasn't sure how this was going to turn out due to how rough my legs were already feeling from that Murph yesterday.  Thought about Chris S's rant and strived to just keep moving.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I have a view that there are exercises that someone needs to always have the capacity to do unbroken in any CrossFit workout. The first three are running, burpees and squats: there is no workout I've seen come up that I would expect the fittest people to have to stop running or break up air squats or burpees. The second two are wallballs and kettlebell swings. These are a little harder because they involve weight, but since the prime mover is the hips, one more rep can always be completed, no matter how many have already been done. Now, once you have that level of fitness it might be a good idea to break up the reps if you're strategizing for your best score, but the capacity has to be there. So when you look at today's workout, be honest with yourself on whether you are breaking up the kettlebell swings because you "have to" or because you want a temporary relief from the discomfort high rep kb swings bring.
MAIN DECISION
Go for best overall time or emphasize a certain portion of it? In other words, game or practice?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM								x
HEAVY
SPEED SCALE
Do each individual station for time, rest as needed between
STAMINA SCALE
Mush everything together into one round
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
High rep kb swings can be rough on new people - thinking of Rhabdo specifically. But might not be anything wrong with doing the same amount of reps, just broken up way more. Try 10 rounds of 200m run and 12 kb swings at a light weight
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 8?
