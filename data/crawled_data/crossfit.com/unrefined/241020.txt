The Essential Air Squat


The air squat is a fundamental movement critical to maintaining mobility and joint health in the ankles, knees, and hips. It is essential for daily activities like sitting and standing, and athletic movements such as running and jumping. Proper technique is key, starting with feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining a neutral spine, and squatting to a depth where the hips are lower than the knees. Mastery of the air squat is crucial before progressing to weighted variations, as it impacts long-term fitness and health, and regular practice is essential for continual improvement.
