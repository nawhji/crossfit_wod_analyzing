Fastest mile in 8 years.
Uphill with the wind, downhill against the wind.
Real feel 32F. The ground is wet, but it's not raining, thankfully.

7:41 !! Haven’t ran in forever , treadmill, have me a good push at the end cause I was able to track it so easily- downside - getting up to 7.5-8 mph took a bit of time but prob made up for it in the end

Yesterday 8:31 with a tweaked hamstring. Fastest split in a 3 mile run. 
Current PR is 6:21 on 2/3/24 as part of a 3 mile race. 
Need to come back to this on a track after my hamstring is better.

Well, that was a goat rope. 
20:19 ran (mostly)/walked over alternately cleared, snowy and icy dirt roads and trails, while Ginger and Scout competed to see who could foil my efforts by wrapping leashes around my legs, pooping, and generally being nuisances. At least it was outside on a beautiful mountain morning, and I didn’t slip or trip.  More than a mile, less than 1.5.

Way to still get work in! I can't remember how cumbersome it can be to take just one dog on a run let alone 2, and definitely not in the snow/ice.  It sounds very frustrating.

Not an equivalent time domain for me compared to 1 mile run but it still worked me good.  Running wasn’t happening this morning and didn’t feel like adding another 2km row to the list today. Did a bunch of weighted box step-ups (20# plate carrier, 24”) as part of warmup/cool down, and a few rounds of GHD sit-ups, ring pull-ups, and weighted walking lunges (30# KB overhead, 20yds) to do a little extra.

Globo wod: If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.   Subs are 2000m row or 100/120 calories assault or echo bike.
