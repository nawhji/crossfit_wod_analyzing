Workout of the Day

On a 2-minute clock for 5 rounds, complete:

100-foot farmers carry

30 anchored sit-ups

Max dumbbell squat cleans in the remaining time


Rest 1 minute between rounds.


‚ôÄ 35-lb dumbbells

‚ôÇ 50-lb dumbbells


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

In today‚Äôs workout, you need to push the pace in order to start working on your score. Set up a farmers carry route that is 50 feet out and 50 feet back. As soon as you get back, put your dumbbells down, put your toes under the dumbbell handles, and begin your sit-ups. The goal is to have at least 30 seconds to perform squat cleans. So, reduce the distance of the carry and reps of the sit-ups as needed. As for the loading of the dumbbells, you should be able to hang on for the entire farmers carry and perform at least 7 squat cleans before needing a quick break. If in doubt today, go lighter and do more reps.


Intermediate option:

On a 2-minute clock for 5 rounds, complete:

100-foot farmers carry

30 anchored sit-ups

Max dumbbell squat cleans in the remaining time


Rest 1 minute between rounds.

Coaching cues:

Play around with your foot position on the squat cleans. Consider keeping your feet in your squat stance and touching the dumbbell on the ground in between your feet. This ‚Äúsumo deadlift‚Äù to squat clean technique can speed up your reps.

Went way too slow on the sit-ups the first round. Carries and SC unbroken but only had about 30s each round to attack. Maybe the distance was further than 100‚Äô? Tried to make a loop around equipment.

35s are the heaviest I have at home. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have hit those numbers with 50s. Started to crash on 4 and had to dig real deep on 5.

Probably should have used heavier DBs, but the sit-ups were max-effort for me (can't remember the last time I did sit-ups or anything similar). The last set of sit-ups was basically a cluster set of singles haha

Great workout! I pushed the pace during the farmers carry and sit-ups to ensure I had at least 30 seconds for squat cleans. I used the 35-lb dumbbells and focused on maintaining solid form, especially on the squat cleans. The sumo deadlift to squat clean technique helped me move faster and save energy. Can't wait to try this again and improve my score next time!

That‚Äôs a killer workout! The 100-foot farmers carry will really test your grip and endurance, while the anchored sit-ups are great for core strength. Completing it in 2 minutes per round is no easy feat‚Äîdefinitely a challenging, full-body session!
Dourado Luxury Car is 
Dubai‚Äôs leading  luxury car dealership
 specializing in new and used luxury cars, exotic cars, and supercars.

Globo wod:  if the area available for farmers carry is less than 25 feet long do 10 foot lengths for 30 seconds fresh as part of warm up, and that's the number of farmers carry lengths you do per round in the WOD.  Otherwise as Rxed.
