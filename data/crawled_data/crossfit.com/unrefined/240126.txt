Scaling:

This couplet will challenge your midline and is more difficult than it looks on paper. This workout falls in a moderate time domain for most. Remember, the longer you work out, the more burpees you have to perform. Newer athletes should reduce the burpees to allow at least 30 seconds of work on the pull-up bar. Remember, the workout starts with burpees.


Intermediate option:

For time:

60 toes-to-bars

*Perform 
8
 burpees at the start of each minute (including the first minute).


Beginner option:

For time:


50 hanging knee raises

*Perform 
5
 burpees at the start of each minute (including the first minute).

M/33/5'7"/216
(23:00) - 100 Burpees 
Burpees 5x8
Toes2Bar 5,5,5,3,2
Rest (5:00)
Burpees 12x5reps
HangingKneeRaises 8x5 + 4 x10
Did this one as a tap out then scale down. I knew I couldn't hold 8 burpees per minute and toes 2 bar as well. Heck, I could've probably got to 60 PullUps faster than toes 2 bar. Got to 40 burpees in 5 minutes then had to tap out. Didn't want to redline today, just move. Rested 5 minutes then just did some beginner volume work in burpees and knee raises. 
Not a fan of toes 2 bar as my hanging is quite unbalanced. My right arm gets hyper fatigued from hanging. 
Just checked the box on doing some damn burpees.

5 burpees every minute. 
Recogizong this as a burpee workout and not a toe 2 bar workout was the battle. I chose a number I could maintain and consistently move with a small reset breather between emoms.

Tried for Rx but after not completing the burpees in time, dropped to 10 burpees/min. There were a few rounds that were nothing but burpees. Must have overdone it this week between workouts. Finished this $!&# show in

Ummm. Thought scaling this to intermediate was the call as I'm not new to CF, but had to throw in the towel after 4 rounds. Was getting only 2 T2B and it was back to burpees. Should have done beginner.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead, but threw in some TTB:
5 Rounds for time (18 min cap)
10 Pull-ups
:30 Plank
10 DL (185#)
30yd Farmer Carry (2x24kg KB)
200m run
16:03
3 min rest
18min AMRAP

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Nothing to rant about
TARGET AUDIENCE
Someone with a great combination of both stamina and flexibility from the hips - especially in terms of pulling. 1-minute L-sit hold from the floor kind of dude
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG

MEDIUM
HEAVY
STRENGTH SCALE
60 strict toes to bar, every time you come down do 15 push-ups
STAMINA SCALE
Do 60 toes to bar for time, then do 60 burpees for time. Record them separately but start immediately after
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
10 kips
10 push-ups
10 box jumps
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 6? I said 7 last time, but didn't do the full thing then either. I'm not sure how accurate this portion is at this time.

Globo wod: If a pullup bar isn't available or suitable for kipping sub 60 v ups, with burpees otm, including 0.  Scale the movements to complete in 20 minutes.  Scaled can do abmat situps if a bar isn't available.
