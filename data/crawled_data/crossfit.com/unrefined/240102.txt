M/218lbs/33/5'7"
21-18-15-12-9-6-3 for time (16:09)
Row Cals
DBThrusters 25lbs (12+9,9+9,8+7,7+5,5+4,6,3)
Scaled down the thrusters to 25. Good call. Did this one as a second conditioning piece after a little slow heavy lift of cleans, PullUps, and FarmerCarry. Did 10 minutes of BurpeeBoxJumps before this one. 
Thrusters were the limiter, I can always pull more. Would have to break up the sets more if I went true to intermediate. Left arm was smoked after this one and then my back blew up afterwards. Got the ice lung afterwards too. Completely wrecked after these two conditioning pieces.

M/33/5'7"/218lbs
Workout w/ Captain ~ (45:00)
3Rds (1:00,0:30Rest)(2:00Rest)
KB ForwardLunges
Sit-ups
KB FarmersCarry
KB SumoSquats
KB BallSquats
KB ReverseLunges
BandedHipThrusts
DBPullOvers(?)
GobletSquats
Rest (30:00)
Row 6K ~ (33:00)(2:45pace)
Got out of work about 15 minutes earlier today. Rushed to changeout, then rushed over to workout with captain. Only 4 of us. It was legday. It sucked. 3Rds of too much Squats and too much lunges. Built in corework was my rest. Pullover were ineffective (doing them wrong?) And tweaked my elbow. Shot the breeze with captain for a few minutes then went to college gym.
Pulled a last minute workout audible today, and it was a good call. Didn't want to putz around for an hour before college gym opened. 
Row was simply a ZONE2 get volume in row. Haven't done 6k in awhile. Pace was slower than I wanted, but was what my body called for.
Was looking forward to the row thrusters workout, but while have to save that one as on my saved to do list for future good workouts.

As rx'd, 15:34.¬†
Knew this one would be bad.¬† Steady on the row, about 1000-1100 cal/hr pace.¬† Broke thrusters 15-6 / 12-6 / 10-5 / 8-4, then unbroken.¬† Wanted to go unbroken on the set of 12, but that was where things were getting dark.¬† First two sets in 6 minutes (13 reps / min), and last 5 sets in 9 minutes (10 reps / min).¬† Not too bad of a fall-off in pace.

Morning and happy New Year fellow .com‚Äôers! RXd at the Y this morning. 
16:48
All thrusters in two sets until the round of 9. Rows got way slower after a 1:10 start for the first round. Gasping for air at the end and got light headed. Don‚Äôt try this one on an empty stomach!

Exactly!  Welcome to CF!  3.5 years in, and it doesn't get any easier, just your scores/times improve!
Love doing a classic weight training "rest" day every now and then, seems so easy what I did pre-CF...
