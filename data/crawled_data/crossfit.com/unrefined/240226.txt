Scaling:

Today’s chipper-style workout should be treated like a sprint. Complete each movement in as few sets as possible. The load of the barbell is moderate, however, the deadlift will feel much lighter than the front squats. Athletes using the prescribed weight should be able to perform at least 10 reps at a time. Go unbroken on the deadlifts if you can — this will really spice things up. Grind through as many front squats as possible because the more you drop it, the more you’ll have to pick it up again. Stick to a number of toes-to-bars that allows you to rest minimally between sets. Consider consistent sets of 5-10 reps with 10-15 seconds of rest between each set.
