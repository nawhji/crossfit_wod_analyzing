Scaling:

Today is a moderately long endurance-focused workout. Maintain a consistent pace on the rower and push the pace on the run. Your pace on the rower is too fast if you are walking out the door on your run. Those performing the workout as prescribed should be able to complete the first row in no more than 4:30 and keep each run to 2:15 or less.
