5 rounds for total reps:

1-minute shuttle run

1-minute rope climb to 15 feet

1-minute rest


25 feet out and 25 feet back = 1 shuttle run.

♂ 155 lb


Post reps to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a grippy breather. Expect to be out of breath and your grip to be taxed. The loading of the barbell should allow you to hang on for at least 5 reps before needing a break. Less-experienced athletes should attempt rope climbs even if they only get 1 rep. This is a great opportunity to practice and develop confidence and technique. Work hard and have fun!


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for total reps:

1-minute shuttle run

1-minute rope climb to 
12 feet

1-minute hang power snatches

1-minute rest


For the shuttle runs, 25 feet out and 25 feet back = 1 shuttle run.

♂

Beginner option:

5 rounds for total reps:

1-minute shuttle run

1-minute 
pull-to-stands

1-minute hang power snatches

1-minute rest


For the shuttle runs, 25 feet out and 25 feet back = 1 shuttle run.


♀ 
35
 lb

♂ 
45
 lb


Coaching cues:

On the setup of the hang power snatch, consider hinging at the hips and keeping your shoulders over the barbell. This will give you more leverage over the barbell and allow you to perform more unbroken reps.

Completed 241206 at the Y. Equipment subs and intermediate weight.  Did assault runner runs, no rope so did pull-up - k2c x5 for each climb. Snatches at 95 lbs. 
ran for 60s > 2 rope climbs > 6-8 snatches each round. Very grippy.

This workout is a great mix of cardio, grip strength, and technique. Focus on controlled breathing during shuttle runs and take your time with rope climbs to build confidence. Use a manageable weight for hang power snatches to maintain form and get in several reps. Remember to rest during the 1-minute break to stay strong for each round. How are you planning to scale it?

Yup, grippy. Too cold to go outside and rely on grip between a rope and barbell. Rope in the gym I went to wasn't high enough to do rope climbs hence that scale.
