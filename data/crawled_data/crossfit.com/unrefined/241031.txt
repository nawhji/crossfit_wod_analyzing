Aging Gracefully Redefined


Conventional beliefs about aging often depict it as an inevitable decline into frailty, with losses in muscle, bone density, strength, and coordination, alongside an increase in illnesses. However, CrossFit has demonstrated that aging does not need to equate to deterioration. Through constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity and paired with sound nutrition, older athletes can improve their fitness at any age, preserving independence, balance, and strength while mitigating risks like falls and chronic diseases.

Rest days are just as important as workout days for gym enthusiasts. They allow the body to
 recover, repair muscle tissue, and prevent burnout or overtraining.

Regards the article…
As one who’s been doing CF since about 2008 and is now 62, my take:  CF definitely slows the aging process, but doesn’t stop it. My most obvious change is a gradual decline in overall fitness and strength, but a marked decrease in upper body strength. I feel decent about my deadlift and squat strength (though they have declined) but am frustrated by my overhead strength. For example, 5-7 strict HSPU 3-4 years ago is now 0-1. Former 95# SP is now more like 80. 
But on the positive side, daily life has not changed; can hike, do manual labor, and non-gym life like 5, 10, even 15 years ago. And I’m stronger than my pre-CF run-centric days. So while my competitive side is bummed at losses in the gym, losses in the realities of life are minimal.
