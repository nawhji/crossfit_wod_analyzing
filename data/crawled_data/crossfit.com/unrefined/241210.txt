Workout of the Day
66
For time:

Run 5,000 meters


Compare to 
240423.


Post time to comments.


Scaling:

If executed properly, this workout challenges the boundaries of human performance and requires no equipment. It's a fantastic test of stamina, endurance, and mental fortitude. Experienced athletes should try for a PR on this benchmark effort. Look back at your previous time to help determine an appropriate pace. Newer athletes should reduce the distance to complete the run in no more than 20 minutes.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd.


Beginner option:

On a 20-minute clock:

Run for distance


Coaching cues:

To avoid inefficient movement patterns while you run, imagine you‚Äôre running on the crossties of a railroad track, keeping your feet right under your body and landing on the balls of your feet.

Rx 27:43
Compare to 240423: 25:00. Just wanted to get it done today but clearly de-conditioned for this after a long time trying to balance healing with still training. Didn‚Äôt help that parts of my body other than lungs and knees started to protest less than halfway through forcing me to slow a little. Hopefully the knees don‚Äôt hate me too much.

That's a very respectable time! Especially considering most people train for a 5k, not just pop up & run one on a random Tuesday in December! Excellent job even though you weren't 100% feeling it!

Rx, on the trueform:
27:09 (~5.4 min/km)
Tried to keep it around 5.5 min/km. 
Pretty sure this is my first 5k on a runner. Definitely makes a difference from regular outdoor running. Last time I went this far I ran on the streets , accidentally ran an extra 300m and was only 40 seconds slower than today‚Äôs effort. Also, probably my longest run in the vivo barefoot shoes, felt great. 
240423
Accidentally went 5,320m. Outside, many hills.

 fast. Does that count?
Looking back, I didn't find times on Rx days. I run 5k occasionally on rest days but apparently not when programmed.

Yes, simple, accessible, scalable, repeatable (obviously), measurable, and it‚Äôs in that sweet spot of 1-3 movements around 2-20 minutes that CrossFit loves. 3 times a year this workout lol. My juco basketball coach made us get this under 23 minutes for a turkey trot ‚úîÔ∏è

Globo wod: As rxed. If you are using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.  Sub 6k row or 330 calories assault or echo bike if running isn't an option due to weather or other factors.
