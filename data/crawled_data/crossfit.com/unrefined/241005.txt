Workout of the Day
For time:

100 double-unders

50 GHD sit-ups

25 power cleans

50 GHD sit-ups

100 double-unders


‚ôÄ 105 lb

‚ôÇ 155 lb


Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout is a pyramid-style workout with a moderately loaded barbell sandwiched between a few bodyweight movements. The management of the power cleans in this workout should be much different from yesterday's squat snatch workout. Today, the loading should allow you to perform a combination of touch-and-go reps and fast singles. Push to finish the power cleans in 3 minutes or less. As for the GHD sit-ups, if you are not regularly performing this movement, you should scale the reps and range of motion.


Intermediate option:

For time:


50
 double-unders

‚ôÇ

Coaching cues:

Relax the quads when you are seated on the GHD. The knees should be bent as you lay back, then squeeze the quads, drive the heels down, and reach for the foot pads to complete the sit-up. This happens on every rep.

Intermediate but as full ROM as I could get from my bench/BB combo GHD sub.
12:37
Dubs were the slowest part as expected but wanted the practice so stuck with it. Did some HPS, HSS, PS, and SS (45-65#) practice afterwards. Lots of reps but didn‚Äôt count. Meant to go heavier but between yesterday‚Äôs bulletproof workout and today‚Äôs WOD some of the joints weren‚Äôt going to have it.
