 Strategically broke each set of CTB pull-ups into 6/4. Did this to save some in the tank for the bar muscle-ups. Still finished the first five rounds a little too quickly (I think). Broke the bar muscle-ups into 4/3, but rested excessively between sets. Maybe could have gone faster if I broke the muscle-ups into 3/2/2, but that‚Äôs a strategy that will have to wait for another day. Good luck, everyone.

Team Workout (4 members)
80 Pull-ups
200 Push-ups

(The team has to accumulate the reps, and the MedBall has to be on the move the whole time)
¬†
Team movement 800m
Plate Carrier (20#) w/Rifle
2 Plate Carriers (20#)
1 Ammo Can (~35#)
Squad Workout (2 teams together)
30yd sled drag/pull (90#)
30yd Bear crawl w/ 35# KB drag
200m run w/ 14# MedBall
Active rest in the plank (anyone not dragging or running)
(Every member has to drag the sled and the BC w/ KB, same rules as event 1 for the MedBall)
Squad Movement 1 km
2xPlate Carriers (20#) w/Rifle

Linc, whoever organized this is a genius. That could have been a mess!  Nice job.

Mike, it was a little bit of organized chaos and setup was extensive, but worth it:)
Jonathan, no ammo, used training rifles.
Jim, I had a hand in shaping it, but it‚Äôs a little funny you called the guy who organized the original last year a genius - he would routinely wear an ‚ÄúASVAB Waiver‚Äù t-shirt to Bulletproof :)
Coastie, it was a blast my man!

Globo wod: The best way to perform these workouts is at an affiliate.  Check map.crossfit.com for an affiliate near you and reach out to see when you can get in and do the workout.  Now If that doesn't work this one can be done at a globo gym. Follow the instructions at games.crossfit.com as far as filming and setup goes.  Make sure you check your pullup bar clearance for Bar Muscleups.  I recommend doing this when the gym is slower, and to get someone to judge you. 
Now for those of you who don't have access to equipment and are not submitting scores, the dumbbells sub for thrusters are 25/35 and 35/50 lbs dumbbells. Sub for bar muscleups are jumping bar muscleups on a Smith machine or to a barbell secured in a rack (pullup bar clearance).
