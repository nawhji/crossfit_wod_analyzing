Scaling:

Today's workout is a classic heavy day and an opportunity to move a little slower relative to the surrounding days. You should aim to lift a heavy load relative to your capacity. If you know your best deadlift single, start your first set of 5 at 70-75% or higher and try to add load to as many of the sets as possible.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx‚Äôd


Beginner option:

For load:


5-5-5-5-5

Deadlift

Find a heavy load and stay there for all 5 sets.

Work on mechanics and safe, efficient movement.

FrontSquat 5-5-3-3-3-3-3
Just hit a slow lift today. Focused on pushing / lower body. Haven't DeadLift for heavy single triple since cracking a rib. 280 felt good, probs could've hit 3 wheels. Grip is limiter for deadlift. FrontSquat was beautiful. A 225 triple makes me feel good about having BackSquat not much stronger. 
Wanted to do a conditioning piece afterwards, but I was not really feeling it. Wasn't tired or fatigued but just felt like too much time to get it in and not campout in the gym all morning.

All double overhand, no HG, then did 1 more @ 150 kg with HG and off course it was nicer.
All time PR is 200 kg, but that was >25 years ago. No need to go down that path anymore. 
Deadlifted barefoot for the first time in many many years and liked it. Normally I use my Nike Metcon 7. 
Do you guys prefer barefoot or w shoes?

5 reps each weight:
185-205-225-235-245-255-265#
Compare to 231003: same mod, 185-205-225-245-275-275-285#
Yeah this was a bust today: a) my lower back has been tight and midline felt fatigued all day; b) and equal to a), I don't trust my lower back any more; c) I can only load my BB up to 315# at home so a true 1RM attempt was unlikely.  I had solid mechanics at 265 but did not want to push the envelope the way I was feeling - listen to the body.

Lincoln - FWIW, I herniated a few discs back in 2018, since then I've gone trap/hex bar only on DLs. Definitely helps having the weight underneath you vs. ever so in front as with a standard BB.

PR from my back injury 2 years ago trying for a 405 PR! Wasn't going to go above 135, but back felt good and rode the hype train until I ran out of time.

I let out an involuntary visceral yell during that PR. I recently hit my previous PR of 445 during Deadcember and took this opportunity to try to beat it. I‚Äôm not sure I could repeat this ever again!

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
I still don't know what to do with myself. I have remained just as useless as I was yesterday, or Sunday, or honestly any day this past week...
WORKOUT THEMES
Max output followed by full recovery. Single modality, weightlifting, squatting with an emphasis on pushing and midline stability
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT
MEDIUM
HEAVY	x
FORMAT/MOVEMENT QUESTIONS
Does my body agree with my mind that I should go for a 1 rep max today?
Would I be better off working on more sets with multiple reps?
Is 18 total reps enough practice for me based on where my technique is at?
Do I want to save it on the 3's and 5's to make sure I get my best single, or do I want to try to hit a 5 and 3 rep max too?
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
Same format, just do 10+ reps each set
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 4

Globo wod:  If you are using iron plates today control the weights on the way down.  If the gym doesn't like noise use pads under the plates.  Dumbbells sub dumbbell deadlifts.  If you max the available dumbbells do AMRAP sets with good form.   If you are in a hotel gym or the heaviest dumbbells available add up to less than 50% of your existing 1 rep max, warm up both movements, then do 5x100m treadmill sprints on max incline resting between sets, then 3 AMRAP sets of dumbbell deadlifts. Rest as needed between sets.
