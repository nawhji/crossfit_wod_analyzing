This one was a long time domain that I haven't hit in a while. BoxStepUps were smooth and consistent. Thruster were tough with the press out. Left shoulder was dead. Thrusters were way harder than imbalances of wall balls previous.  Couldn't catch my breath on the run. Legs weren't too heavy but arms were pumped. Had to rest halfway through to try and catch breathe. Didn't catch it on restart. I remember this one as tough last time and today was no different.

Women‚Äôs Rx
Grace 3:34
4:30 rest, then
Isabel 3:04
4 min rest, then
2 rds of Rx Kelly
12:30 (somewhere around there anyway)
Can‚Äôt recall the last full Kelly I did but I got most of that running and WBS in yesterday at Bulletproof, so I decided to only add a couple of rounds after Grace and Isabel.
