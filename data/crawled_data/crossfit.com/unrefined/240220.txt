Did this one at the PoudreTrail near the Poudre Learning Center. Haven't ran at this point of the PoudreTrail in quite a while. This is my summer midday run spot as opposed to the early morning post work 35th Ave point of the trail. 
Intervals were tough. Could've went harder on a few, but ran out of gas close to 50secs on a few. Overall, hit the sprint stimulus. I don't do enough just running workouts besides easy runs, long runs, and straight tempo runs. Running conditioning is solid, need to test my 5K and see where my long run stamina is at.

7 x 250m row, 4 min rest btwn rows
52.9, 49.5, 48.9, 50.1, 49, 49.5, 50.1
hoped to hit ~55 secs, so most rows @ ~ 50 was a nice surprise.
After #5, could feel the lack of power—no finishing push in final 100m, just hanging on.

Did a combo of run and row
200m run
:38.5
:37.7
:36.9
:36.5
:36.8
Then, 250m row (C2, drag 6, 39-42s/m)
:44.0
:44.5
After the 5th round of run things were getting tight in ways that said “if you try this again right now you will probably pull something”. So, I listened to my body and opted for 2 rounds of row. It was good for a comparison to subbing distances for running too.
Compare to 21112: 3 rds of Manion (empty BB) and 4 quarter mile efforts on a spin bike (each around :45) - was still recovering from back injury so nothing was a sprint.

Article is gold!
By coincidence, yesterday I did:
Every 2 minutes for 10 rounds:
Sprint 100 meters
Down at the local track, regular shoes (not spikes).  Not sure I can quite hit that 5th gear any longer, but these were definitely sprints as opposed to runs.  Consistently ~15 seconds.  Walked/jogged the turns during rest breaks.  Hamstrings survived; did plenty of warmup and did not go 100% for the first couple.

A little slower… I did down and back to start this time, can’t remember if I did the same last time (no excuses, just curious). Note to self: try straight 200 (no down and back) next time.

Today’s workout
7 runs, probably closer to 400 yards than meters. Odd runs started uphill and finished downhill, even runs started down/finished uphill. 
First and last runs were 50 sec, the middle 5 included 2 at 49 and 3 at 48 sec. Rests started at 4 min, then became 3.

Nice work! Consistency is more important than speed. It’s good if you can go fast once but better if you can go fast many times.

Globo wod: If you are using a conventional treadmill use a medium incline today. Substitute full gym shuttle sprints (down back down back),  250m row sprints or 11/14 calories assault or echo bike sprints if you don't have a suitable track or place to do full length sprints.
