Scaling:

Today‚Äôs couplet incorporates a heavy barbell and a gymnastics movement. If you have a rack, use it. If not, use a load that allows you to take the barbell from the ground and safely transition it to the back rack or change the movement to a front squat. The load of the barbell should be moderately heavy, however, once the barbell is on your back, you should be able to grind through each set unbroken. As long as you can maintain consistent sets of 5 ring dips, perform the prescribed number of reps.

BarDips (9+6,6+6,5+4)
Squats weren't bad. Unbroken and a light load. Dips were broken up strategically. Left elbow tendon is tender. Did this workout as just a lifting session.
Think I missed the stimi on this one. Maybe heavier squat like 165lbs.

As rx‚Äôd, 10:27.
Had wanted to try unbroken for the squats, but this felt pretty heavy.¬† Broke 10-5 / 8-4 / 9.¬† Did ring dips in sets of 6 until the last round, where I broke them up more to try to finish quickly.¬† Legs and chest already feeling it this morning from this one.

9:56, had to do bar dips- no access to rings 
for some reason, did 21 for the first set of squats :D not sure what I was looking at! so, 21-12-9 @ 155 and prescribed reps for dips. Would have loved to try the ring dips for more of a challenge but still a good workout!

155# BS, Rx rep scheme
11:54
Squats unbroken, dips broken into 3 rounds each time. 
Time consuming logistics, as my rings hang from the squat rack pull-up bar, so I had to partially unload, remove bar, return and reload bar each round, as I can‚Äôt clean 155#. Still, a fun one.

Did our Friday Bulletproof workout instead:
3 Rounds for Time (18min cap)
680m run
30yd Walking Lunge
5 Thruster (65#)
30yd Farmer Carry (2x24kg KB)
8 KB Swing (24kg KB)
16:00
3 min rest
18min AMRAP
500m row (drag 5)
10 Knees to Elbow
10 Pull-ups
1 min Plank
8 Tire Strikes (32# Sledge)
3 Rds (5 sec to spare)
Meant to do Intermediate scale WOD but with dip bar (no rings at work) after this but I ran out of time.  Maybe I will do it tomorrow at home.

Glad you ran out of time!  Doing this after your bulletproof workout would have been a LOT of work.

For those of us who do not live in countries using the imperial system, it would be really great, and simpler, to have the wods in metric units.

Globo wod: see the notes above for workout execution.  Dumbbell sub is dumbbell front squats 55/80lb dumbbells. Men if you are using 50lb dumbbells today(hotel) double the squat reps.  Subs for ring dips are TRX dips, weighted bar dips, or 2 to 1 bar dips or elevated pushups onto dumbbells.
