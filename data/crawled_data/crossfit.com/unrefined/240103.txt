Scaling:

This simple workout is a physical and mental grind. Find a pace that feels challenging but still manageable for the duration of the workout. Use a step or jump to get up off the ground AND over the box; getting from one side to the next and on the ground counts as an Rx'd rep. As long as you can maintain an average of 5 reps per minute, keep the Rx'd box height.


Intermediate option:
