For clarity, the run option is meant to be completed without load.

Did this one because I didn't want to go to the gym and do ohs/quarter mile run intervals on the treadmill at the powergym. Part of MURPH prep. Feet and soles and plantar hurt a little at the start, but was fine. Yoga afterwards. Lungs were iced out from fresh not cold morning run

I am bouncing between the current WODs and those for 2010. Today's 2010 is Griff. I love this WOD, but no running as I mentioned above. So, the current one was a good one to do. 
Cheers!

Globo wod: If possible get outside and do this one today, run or ruck.  Use a backpack or ruck sack if rucking and use a trail in a park.  If it's all you have a 20/14lb vest plus heavy stick/pipe or body armor with a duty belt (use training equipment) and faux rifle can work (or if you're in the military use simulation gear).  Firefighters can use turnouts and air tank/gear. For runners if you are in a global gym using a conventional treadmill use a slight incline.   Row sub is 8000 m row, outdoor bike is 12 mile bike ride, Assault/echo bike 400 calories.

i have a question: this 35 minutes goal, is it based on jogging the whole thing or brisk walking? 
I ran part of it and couldn’t get it below this time goal. Maybe my route has too big of a hill🤔

Started out with the ruck and umbrella ☔️, my knee started hurting too bad to finish the ruck. I was on pace to make 35 min. cap.

Loaded the plate carrier to 40# (so glad I got it, way better than the alice frame I used last time)
35:24
Compare to 230821: 2 mile ruck, alice frame with 45# plate, 30:13 (mix between run/walk); done after an annual fitness test
Mostly jogged it today with a little walking, especially to warm up at the start - knees are feeling it from Lumberjack 20 yesterday.

Man I know I'm being critical, it's just that this is a prime example of how, to me, at least, advertisements can throw a little shade on a perfectly good thing. This is a great workout. I would hate either option, which means it's definitely something I need to be doing. And especially the Ruck option is something less formal, which means it requires more athleticism and self-coaching. When it's listed with a promotion link to buy product to go with it, I just wonder how much of it was put here for fitness purposes and how much was put here due to conflicted interest.
TARGET AUDIENCE
People who sign up for Tough Mudders or Half Marathons looking to win, not just happy they compete. Or people who are potential customers for GORUCK.
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT

MEDIUM

LOWER-BODY INJURY SCALE
The general theme today is single modality, which means pick one single thing and get a great dose on it alone. So for you that could mean Death by Pull-ups. Or 30 minutes of muscle-up practice. Or accumulating 5 minutes spent in an L-sit through the course of the day.
INTENSITY SCALE
Whichever option you do, split it up into smaller chunks with some rest between. The intensity will be higher, which means lowering the overall volume is probably a good idea.
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
AMRAP in 20 minutes of:
Run 200 meters
50-meter farmers walk
[insert one thing you suck at]

Dude, I did not even register the existence of the GORUCK stuff until you mentioned it.  I know they make good gear that helps folks with their fitness journey, but I agree that it is out of place here on the WOD page.  A banner on the site home page probably wouldn't throw that shade you mention.

I had a very similar thought on the conflict of interest and programming.
