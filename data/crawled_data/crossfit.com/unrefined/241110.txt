Primer on Protein, Part 2: Bones


In Part 2 of the "Primer on Protein" series, the focus shifts to the role of dietary protein in bone health. CrossFit’s nutrition prescription highlights the importance of animal foods (meat, fish, eggs, etc.), which provide high-quality protein. Protein-rich foods, especially those cooked on the bone or containing skin, provide key amino acids necessary for bone health. Diets lacking these foods can lead to lower bone density and increased fracture risk, while high protein intake, especially in older adults, is associated with stronger bones and reduced risk of osteoporosis.
