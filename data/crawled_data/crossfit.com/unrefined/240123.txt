Scaling:

Today's workout is a variation of the benchmark workout Angie. You have 3 minutes to work through each movement, accumulating as many reps as possible. Your goal is to perform 30-70+ reps of each movement. Avoid pushing to failure on the push-ups and pull-ups. Consider performing smaller sets that you can maintain with minimal rest to keep moving. Choose movement variations that allow you to perform at least 10 reps per minute in each movement.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx'd


Beginner option:

For reps:

3 minutes of 
ring rows

3 minutes of 
hand-elevated push-ups

3 minutes of sit-ups

3 minutes of air squats


Resources:


The Kipping Pull-Up


The Push-Up


The AbMat Sit-Up


The Air Squat


The Ring Row

As rx'd, 77 / 72 / 86 / 140 (375 total reps).
Pull-ups ‚Äì did a set of 25, then a couple sets of 10, then sets of 5 until the end where I was down to ones and twos.¬† By minutes ‚Äì 35/20/22.
Push-ups ‚Äì started with sets of 10 every 20 seconds, then had to do 5 and 5, then ones and twos again.¬† Minutes ‚Äì 30/22/20.
Sit-ups ‚Äì tried to just keep plugging through.¬† Short breaks to get a bit more oxygen in.¬† Minutes ‚Äì 35/26/25.
Squats ‚Äì tried not to stop and keep pushing the pace.¬† Easy to go slow on squats.¬† Minutes ‚Äì 50/42/48.
Legs crumpled at the end.¬† Still shaky an hour later.¬† Great dose.

Paul my man! Coach would find a dozen different ways to make us feel like we suck at push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and squats. November 2005 was my first workout. 06-08 was still the Golden Era for me. Also 19-20
Great work dude!

Ribs still bruised or strained, so no pull-ups. Disappointed I couldn‚Äôt do sit-ups either.  Done after a half day of downhill skiing. 
80 push-ups 
114 squats
61/5‚Äô8‚Äù/156

Elbows sustained the work, so happy about that.  About half of the pull-ups were strict.  All of the push-ups were strict.  Squats unbroken, just kept a steady pace.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
Man this is an interesting twist. Usually in the AMRAP (time priority) format it's easier to fall into a comfortable pace, knowing the work is going to end at whatever given time. This is where I find it helpful to set little landmarks and not even look at the timer. 3 minutes of squats, for example; how fast can I get to 22?... okay, good, now how fast can I get to 37?... man I'm closer than I think to 60, so let's get there... all without stopping; next thing you know you'll be 150 squats in and at that point might as well finish off the rest of the 3 minutes unbroken. Also, 3 minutes straight of any of these movements might be a lot of volume for new kids. Split this thing up.
MAIN DECISION
Have I done Angie enough to base my workout off that, or should I just use today as another practice? Or just do Angie?
					SHORT		MEDIUM		LONG
LIGHT								x
MEDIUM
HEAVY
SPEED SCALE
10 rounds of 10 seconds at each movement. Rest as needed between. Record the most reps you did in any of the intervals
CONSTANT WORK FOR 3 MINUTES SCALE
Sub bar hang for pull-ups, sub plank hold (top of push-up) for push-ups, pace squats and sit-ups to go unbroken. Practice pull-ups and push-ups in the warmup
NEW TO CROSSFIT SCALE
3 rounds of 1 minute at each station, or 6 rounds of 30 seconds. Squat hold here if the form is inconsistent
GENERAL FEAR LEVEL: 7?
