Scaling:

Today's workout is short, intense, and grippy. The load of the barbell should be relatively light and allow you to hang on to potentially go unbroken in the first set. Try not to break any set more than once if needed. The pull-ups should feel more challenging than normal because of the pull in the snatches. Aim to complete the pull-ups in no more than 2 sets each round. This workout should be fast. Choose options that allow you to do more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.


Intermediate option:

3 rounds for time:

15 hang power snatches

10 pull-ups


‚ôÄ 55 lb


‚ôÇ 75 lb


Beginner option:

3 rounds for time:


10 hang power snatches


10 jumping pull-ups


‚ôÄ 35 lb


‚ôÇ 45 lb

3Rds ~ (10:00)
15 HangPowerSnatches 75lbs (8,7)
10 PullUps (5,5)
Knew that was going to hit failure fast on PullUps, so snatches were methodical broken up. 30 pullups in 10 minutes will blow up my arms everytime. Snatches were just another random 1 day a week of a snatch variation. 
Felt like today's pull complements yesterday's push quite well. As well as high pulls complement hang snatches. I hope that these moderate weight pulling accessories/technique work helps in the long run, because I would rather just go heavy.

As rx'd, 4:47.
First round in 1 minute, but slowed from there.¬† Was shooting for 1:30 per round ‚Äì and might have had that, but tore open a callous on the last set of snatches.¬† Snatches were 15 / 10-5 / 6-3-3-3.¬† Pull-ups 15 / 15 / 6-5-2-2.¬† Nice to know I can still go full send when I want to.

4:55 RX.  This workout is very deceptive.  I do Fran unbroken with ease.  I expected this workout to be easier and faster.  I found myself having to break up the snatches 10 and 5 in the second round, and the last round I broke up the snatches and pull ups 10 and 5.  #grip killer

This workout humbled me üòÖ I had to adjust the weight down. I‚Äôm not familiar with the snatch, so I was over ambitious trying to stick to the intermediate level!
Snatches 
95lb rx / 45lb rx / 45lb rx 
Pull Ups(with a kick up)
13 then 2 / 10 then 5 / 9 then 6
Time: 7:40

There aren't many Sparty dudes I like, and I will say you're one of the few. I appreciate you my man!
