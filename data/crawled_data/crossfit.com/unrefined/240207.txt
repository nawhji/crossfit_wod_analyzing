Scaling:

Time to get gymnasty. The goal of the freestanding shoulder taps is to reach a point of balance in a handstand and begin the shoulder taps. A rep is counted every time a hand touches a shoulder. Challenge yourself to reach balance before beginning the shoulder taps rather than wildly throwing your feet in the air and frantically looking for a shoulder to tap. If you struggle to find a point of balance freestanding, you are better off practicing against the wall. Performing shoulder taps with your stomach facing the wall will be easier than performing shoulder taps with your back to the wall. Scale the difficulty of the rope climbs to allow yourself at least 1 rep every 20-30 seconds.


Intermediate option:

For reps:

3 minutes of shoulder taps in a 
handstand against the wall

3 minutes of 
rope climbs
 (15 feet)

2 minutes of shoulder taps in a 
handstand against the wall

2 minutes of 
rope climbs

1 minute of shoulder taps in a 
handstand against the wall

1 minute of 
rope climbs


Beginner option:

For reps:

3 minutes of shoulder taps in a 
pike position on the floor

3 minutes of 
pull-to-stands

2 minutes of shoulder taps in a 
pike position on the floor

2 minutes of 
pull-to-stands

1 minute of shoulder taps in a

Yeah, totally checked that box today.
Beginner scale (but with feet on 36" platform for piked STs)
45/11
28/7
17/5
Warmed up with HS holds, back to wall, while shifting weight right to left.  Did 1 legless rope climb to 10' in warm-up.  It was quickly apparent that the elbows were only going to handle so much today, and the cold air was affecting my grip quite a bit.  Still got a good pump out of the Beginner scale options.

Rehab scale
Shoulder taps wall-facing, hands 36" from wall: 70+43+25 = 138
L pull-ups, mostly kipped: 30+18+8 = 56
194 total reps
Fell 1x on taps when rehab shoulder gave out; broke every 10~20 reps. Best LPU set = 5.
Considering where I was 3 weeks ago, I'll take it.

Globo wod: sub towel pullups or pullups using a lat pulldown rope hung over the pullup bar for rope climbs.  For handstand hold shoulder taps if your globo doesn't allow handstands do heavy dumbbell holds overhead,  and press one dumbbell with the other held in lockout,  alternating arms.
