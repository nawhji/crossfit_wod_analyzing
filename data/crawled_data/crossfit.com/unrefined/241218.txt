Workout of the Day
74
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:

30 double-unders

10 burpees-to-rings

5 ring muscle-ups


Set the rings to 6 inches above reach.


Post reps to comments.


Stimulus and Strategy:

In today’s triplet, expect to feel some movement function interference. While 5 muscle-ups may not be a big number, the accumulated fatigue from double-unders and burpees will make those 5 reps feel more challenging.


Scaling:

Reduce the reps of all three movements to complete each round in 3 minutes or less.
Spend 30 seconds on double-under attempts or perform single-unders. Reduce the height of the rings for the burpee target. Perform jumping ring muscle-ups or low-ring transitions.
In case of injury or limitation, perform 30 seconds of work on any machine for the double-unders. Perform up-downs for the burpees. For the ring muscle-ups, perform a single-arm ring row.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:


15
 double-unders

10 burpees-to-rings


3
 ring muscle-ups


Set the rings to 6 inches above reach.


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:


15 single-unders


7 burpees


3 low-ring muscle-up transitions


Coaching cues:

When performing the burpees to a ring, consider putting a mark on the floor under the rings. This mark is where you want to put your hands. Then, when you jump your feet to your hands, your feet will be directly under the rings.

Modified Lincoln scale
60 single unders w/weighted rope
10 burpees
5 pull-ups/5 ring dips
5 rounds in 11:45
Burpees hardest movement for me. Perhaps it’s the SS and high volume air squats from yesterday, but my upper hammies were very sluggish coming off the floor and into the jump.

Globo wod: if rings are not available sub bar musclups and burpees to the pull up bar.  If bar muscleups can't be done sub 2 to 1 chest to bar pullups and TRX or weighted dips.

Scaled/subbed
12 min AMRAP
60 Singles
10 Burp to bar (6 inch above reach)
5 CTB Pull-ups
5 Bar dips
5rds +60+10+5+4 (finished 6th round at 12:01)
No rings today and MUs weren't going to be a thing anyway.  Worked on DUs in warmup but it didn't go well so opted for double the number of singles.  Practiced DUs again afterward.
