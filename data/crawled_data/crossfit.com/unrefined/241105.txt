Workout of the Day
117
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes of:

20 
burpees

20 
air squats

20 box jump-overs

20 air squats

20 toes-to-bars


♀ 20-inch box

♂ 24-inch box


Post rounds and reps to comments.


Scaling:

Today’s workout is a longer effort with a large volume of bodyweight movements. This effort will be very similar to a workout like Cindy where you are moving at a steady pace for 20 minutes. All athletes should aim to complete a single round in 5 minutes or less. If the prescribed exercises don’t allow for this, scale the reps and/or difficulty of the movement. For example, scale the toes-to-bars by reducing the reps or performing 20 hanging knee raises. Work hard and have fun with this one.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:


15
 burpees


15
 air squats


15
 box 
step
-overs


15
 air squats


15 hanging knee raises


♀ 
12
-inch box

♂ 
20
-inch box


Coaching cues:

Master the basics. The air squat is a simple yet effective movement. Don’t knock it just because it is “easy.” Challenge yourself to maintain solid mechanics. The hips move back and down, heels down, knees out, lumbar arch maintained, and hips finish below the knees. Don’t skimp on these points of performance.

Completed 11/7 at the Y. Rx except TTB were hanging from starts, all strict. 
3 rounds even.  
didn’t have it today. No push and was catching my breath most of the time. Air squats made BJO way more challenging.

Steady burpees all 20

10/10 box jumps about 5sec rest between
T2B I broke up 6x3 plus last 2 reps
My bar has no grip it's smooth, so grip slips easy, any idea on helping with a smooth bar? The ones at the gym are better. But still a kick ass workout, plus I did 5rounds 3min each of Muay thai work

Then, true to OCD form, with what little was left in the tank, I finished round 5  @ 24:33. Favorite style WOD:  set the engine to GO! until the buzzer & do a little more after that.

3 + 60 rx
first 20 Burpees in a minute and last box jumps also in a minute
This felt a little bit like Kelly (except this time she came for my hipflexors). Kelly is one of my favourite benchmarks btw.
