Scaling:

Today‚Äôs workout pairs grunt work with barbell stamina. The barbell movement in this workout increases in technical difficulty to add a unique challenge. As you become more tired, can you maintain your technique to power through the workout? The loading of the barbell should feel moderate and allow you to complete the shoulder presses in 4 sets or less. The incorporation of the hips in both the push press and push jerk should make the loading feel easier. Choose a load that allows you to perform the movements as written and practice the more technically demanding exercises. Work hard and have fun.

For time:

20 shoulder presses

Hmmm. So I‚Äôm doing 1 round of ‚Äú
20 shoulder presses
200-meter farmers carry
30 push presses
200-meter farmers carry
40 push jerks
200-meter farmers carry
‚Äú
As quickly as possible and timing myself. I‚Äôve understood that part. Thank you. 
But I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by ‚Äúscaling the workout‚Äù and ‚Äúcomfortable to do 4 sets‚Äù. What counts as a set? How many reps in a set? How much rest are we talking between the sets? 4 sets until what? I can‚Äôt pick the bar up anymore or something? Until I‚Äôm dead? I‚Äôm abit confused there.

Broke once for SP, twice for PP, thrice for PJ. Only set the DBs down once each FC.  Great shoulder and grip pump.  Glad for the easy day on the legs - fairly sore from Chelsea+1 yesterday and want the break before Manion on Monday.

I‚Äôm new to CrossFit. I can see the workout says ‚Äúfor time‚Äù which I researched and find it means you do the a set number of sets/rounds as quickly as possible. But this workout doesn‚Äôt have a set number of rounds it wants me to do. It says ‚ÄúThe loading of the barbell should feel moderate and allow you to complete the shoulder presses in 4 sets or less‚Äù but I don‚Äôt understand why it said to specifically complete the shoulder presses in for 4 sets or less. Is the workout 4 rounds/sets of all those exercises? Someone explain please.

The 4 sets or less is to help you determine what weight to use if you are scaling the workout.  It is saying choose a weight that is comfortable to do 4 sets, but it is not telling you to do 4 rounds.  You only do 1 round.

Globo wod: dumbbell sub for shoulder to overhead work is the same dumbbells used for farmers carry.  If necessary use 25ft segments for the farmers carry, adding up to 200m.  If there's no room accumulate 90 seconds of a dumbbell hold of the same weight in the farmers carry position.
