Scaling:

Grace was 
first posted
 on CrossFit.com on June 24, 2004, and 
Isabel
 on Nov. 11, 2004. They are two of the fastest CrossFit benchmark workouts — top athletes can complete either of these workouts unbroken and in less than 1:30. Reduce the load as needed so you can perform multiple reps unbroken and complete the workout in less than 10 minutes. Athletes who are less familiar with Olympic lifting should take time to drill the mechanics and drastically reduce the load.


Intermediate option:

30 clean and jerks for time

OR

30 snatches for time


♀ 75 lb

Beginner option:
