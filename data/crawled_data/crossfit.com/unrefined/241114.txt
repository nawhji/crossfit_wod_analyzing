The Primer on Protein, Part 3: Mental Health


Part 3 of the "Primer on Protein" series emphasizes the crucial role of protein in supporting mental health alongside physical health. Protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy provide essential amino acids, such as tryptophan and tyrosine, which are vital for producing key neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin promotes a positive mood and resilience, while dopamine drives motivation and focus. A lack of these amino acids can negatively impact mental well-being, contributing to conditions like depression and anxiety. CrossFit‚Äôs nutrition prescription prioritizes high-quality protein intake to support both physical and mental health.
