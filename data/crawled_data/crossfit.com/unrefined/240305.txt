Scaling:

We are going heavy in today’s workout. Remember, heavy is relative to each athlete’s capacity. This complex is meant to be performed unbroken — once the barbell is picked up, it does not return to the ground until the complex is complete or you fail the set. Remember, a failed set still counts as an attempt. Athletes should continue to add load across as many sets as possible as long as technique remains solid.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d


Beginner option:
