DNF yesterday = no rest today. Sprained fingers are still sore but I pushed through this in 22:20:
5 rounds
500m row
15 left-arm dumbbell snatches
15 right-arm dumbbell snatches
30-lb DB from ground (CFO standard)
6~7(?) snatch sets unbroken. Slower pace vs 240313 was kind to fingers (~2:04/500m vs ~1:54).
