CrossFit Mobility 101: Three Common Mobility Mistakes
  


Improving mobility is essential for performance and injury prevention in CrossFit, but athletes often make mistakes that slow their progress. Common errors include failing to identify specific mobility limitations, over-relying on passive techniques like foam rolling, and neglecting strength work to reinforce new ranges of motion. By assessing specific areas, using effective stretching techniques, and incorporating heavy, controlled movements, athletes can enhance their mobility more efficiently and see better results in their workouts.
