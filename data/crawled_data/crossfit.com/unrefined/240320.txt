M/33/5'7"/216lbs
E1.5MOM 10Rds (15:00)
PullUps 50 (5,5,5,5,5,5)(4,4,4,4+4)
Squats 100
ABSitUps 50
Rest (5:00)
Then,
1.0Miles - 10 Skylaps (8:00) 
Did this one as a last Murph prep for volume. Gonna do weight rucksack this year with 20lbs. I usually only use a sprint running camelback with 10lbs.
PullUps were strong! Did 30 in about (7:30)! Squats and situps were all filler no killer. 
Great session today at the college gym. Revitalizing. Did a 1 mile time trial after and hit (8:00). My short time cap (<10:00) is strong. Trusted my fitness for the run and recovered well. Great pulling/running/core session.

No rope, so 4 mile trail run with hills to try to burn off some residual wall ball soreness, then to the playground for:
11 rounds of 15 reps each, alternating between hanging knee raises on monkey bars, inverted rows on climbing apparatus & TRX pull ups.  No idea of the rope climb to whatever that is ratio, but grip  said it was close enough.
28:25 (run not included)

No rope at the Y. Used the same sub I used in 2022. 5 air squats + 5 knee to elbow + 5 pull-ups = 1 rope climb. 
21:24
compare to: 22:29
grip and arm/back fatigue were a major factor today after a physical workday yesterday!
