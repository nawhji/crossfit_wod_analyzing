A Gym in Every Garage

Hi community. Letting you know that I had a small crash while riding a scooter in Bangkok. A taxi came into me from the side and crushed a little my little right toe. Apart from some scratches from my slide into the road, that was it. I feel well and surgery on my toe went well too. Now I'll be using crutches during 4 weeks, and for those who wonder what is the purpose of single-leg squats, there you have it. I just went to a session of phisiotherapy to get used to these crutches and obviously it was a piece of cake. Take care, see you back soon, and Crossfit is Life! ‚ù§Ô∏è
