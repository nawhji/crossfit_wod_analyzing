Scaling:

Today’s workout falls within a moderate time domain. All of the holds and hangs are cumulative. Break as needed and chip away. To keep the workout moving, scale the L-sit hold to a variation that allows you to maintain at least a 10-second hold. Scale the hang to a variation that allows you to maintain around 30 seconds at a time. The load on the barbell should be light-moderate. You should be able to perform at least 10 reps unbroken with the weight you choose. Work hard and have fun!

Just did BoatHold since I have nowhere near an LSit. Maybe could've tried some drills but whatever. Hangs were new. Need more hanging endurance. Left arm was dead. Pushpress was smooth sets of 10, not too heavy.

Good move. I can do TTB and KTE while hanging from a bar, but it destroys my shoulders…not the delts, but the joint…for weeks thereafter. Better to give a little on grip work to “live to lift another day.”

Globo wod: dumbbell sub for shoulder to overhead are 35/50lb dumbbells.  L sits use rings/TRX, dip bars, two benches or boxes,  parallellets, or dumbbells.  Don't do hanging L-sits from a pullup bar except as a last resort, if this is the only option accumulate 45 seconds of an L-sit hanging from a pullup bar where hanging or L-sits are indicated.
