Scaling:

Today‚Äôs chipper is a sprint, but expect significant localized muscle fatigue. Workouts with conflicting movement patterns are a great way to build strength and stamina ‚Äî you also quickly find out how many repetitions you can do before hitting failure. If you have done the 
Hero workout JT
, you‚Äôll understand the feeling.


The load of the barbell should be relatively light and allow you to perform the overhead squats in 3 sets or less. Reduce the volume first when scaling the GHD sit-ups, handstand push-ups, or ring muscle-ups. If you modify the muscle-ups, perform a challenging variation of a low-ring muscle-up transition.


Intermediate option:

For time:

50 GHD sit-ups (to parallel)

40 overhead squats

30 burpees


10
 handstand push-ups


5
 ring muscle-ups


‚ôÄ 55 lb


‚ôÇ 75 lb


Beginner option:

For time:

50 
sit-ups

40 overhead squats

30 burpees

20 
dumbbell shoulder presses

10 
low-ring muscle-up transitions


‚ôÄ 35-lb barbell and 10-lb dumbbells

Rx (low ceiling RMUs)
13:12
For RMUs I set the height to have my butt off the ground and legs out without a push off. OH squats were the killer for me. Broke them into 3 sets but was gassed going into burpees.
Son(16)

OH@95lbs, 10 HSPUs and the RMUs were low, with feet underneath and pushing off.

Did 24.2, results there, then after a 4 to 5 min rest:
Beginner'ish
50 Butterfly AbMat sit-ups
40 OHS (45#)
30 Burpees
20 DB press (35# DBs)
10 low ring MU transitions (at least as best I could with the rig I have)
16:25 I think
Didn't press the pace on anything and scaled a ton, as I was worked pretty good after 24.2.  Feeling beat up, looking forward to rest day.

As a way to shake off nerves and frustration from 24.2, I did this as 30sec. on 30sec. off until getting through each movement in order with prescribed reps.
I did HSPU with a 2x 25lb plate deficit on each side. 
Finished in 14:27. 
GHD was 12-13-13-12
OHS was 12-13- 14-1
Burpee was 8-12-10
HSPU was 8-8-4
RMU was 3-7
Felt really good to do it this way. Rest tomorrow.

Champions Club Scaling Notes
RANT
So the main reason I don't do the General Fear Level section right now is because, for the first time since probably 2009, I am not following up-to-date on the main site (in '09 I did CrossFit Football's In-season workouts during my basketball season). Since September I've either been letting the people in the gym program a string of workouts, or digging back in the archives. First it was year-to-date from 2003, and now because '03 didn't have a leap year I'm in '04. And fellas (meaning the veterans on here), I'd highly recommend at least looking back and studying them, if not going through a stretch yourself. It's really interesting to see the difference in the themes. There is a question I'd like you all to ask yourselves any time you see the new WOD posted: is this designed to get me better at CrossFit or is this designed to get me better at something other than CrossFit?  What do you guys think the answer for that is for today's workout? How would that compare to yesterday's Open workout, or Wednesday's mile run?
SCALING QUESTIONS
Do I want to keep the integrity of the movements and lose speed/intensity, or scale the movements and keep the speed?
1/2 or 1/3 ROM GHD sit-ups at full reps or full ROM at less reps? Or sub in L--sits altogether?
Am I kipping handstand push-ups and muscle-ups or am I going strict?
Would I benefit from splitting the reps in half and doing 2 rounds?

Good rant and question Chris--5 or 6 years ago this would be "to get better at Crossfit" but now it's to maintain flexibility and giving myself a challenge, while still trying to 
"get after it":)

The programming has definitely changed over the years. Rare to see 21-15-9 rep schemes now, and seems we do fewer straight heavy days (perhaps still in recovery from Ben Smith‚Äôs programming). Coach G always said CF was guided by the science and results/improvement, so perhaps hq is either experimenting, or has found these newer workouts to build better fitness?  
Speaking of Ben‚Äôs programming, I loved Dave Castro‚Äôs guest programmer initiative. Would be great to have Nicole, Spealler, and some of the OG‚Äôs come back for a 2 week stretch.

I did what you recommended and took a look at a swath of several different years and did see some changes in programming, but it's hard (at least for me) to tell whether or not they are strictly driven by getting better at CrossFit.  I remember reading several of Coach's posts about certain movements where he stated that if he were to go back and do it again he would do it different or de-emphasize certain movements (like the kipping pull-up).  There was a noticeable change in 2019/2020 before Coach left that saw an increase in gymnastics fundamentals type of work like SLIPS which has fallen off the programming, but it seems like more gymnastic grounded movements (i.e. push-up, pull-up, rope climb, GHD, TTB, etc.) have stuck around with less heavy 21-15-9 couplets/triplets programmed like Jim pointed out.  Not saying any of it is bad, just pointing out what I noticed.  I'd like to offer that any time something becomes a sport, especially one where people start getting compensated to do it (and getting accolades is a form of compensation for some), there will be a drift in training to specifically make competitors better at that sport.  It's likely less noticeable with CF unless you do things like you have with looking back and pulling things out of the archive (especially pre-Games era), because the nature of the Games events (and yes the Open workouts are part of that cycle) revolve around the CF mantra of constantly varied (and you are so right that DC is a master at designing these workouts).  Sort of like Mike, these days any workout I do is more along the lines of trying just to not slow down vice get better at CF.
In my opinion to sum up what you referenced about workouts that serve to make you better at CF or something else: 1 mile run = something else; Open 24.1 and 24.2 = make you better at CF because they are there to do that and find out who is good enough to be "invited" to proceed on the path to the Games.
Thanks again for your thought provoking rants my friend!

Jim, I remember when I was in high school I would almost always skip the heavy days, but I really needed them as a player and in college I learned better and it helped me. I used to hate coaching the straight max effort heavy days, but I've also changed my attitude on those because I can really slow things down, talk more, and there's not as much sense of urgency. I'd be curious to see a two-week stretch of programming from you...
Lincoln, the nasty thing about Dave's workout is that even though they're part of a big test for CrossFit-specific stuff, they seem very much in the lines of second-phase adaptation stuff. What athlete wouldn't be wasting time getting better at deadlifts, rowing, and jumping rope? I can't think of one. When you get into the "judging reps" area of CrossFit, that is when the list of exercises gets decreased and, most importantly, speed does as well. Tabata thrusters at 65 pounds for 2 cycles is absolutely brutal, and getting 12 reps in 20 seconds is exponentially more difficult than getting 11, but it's also really getting into some gray lines with regards to range of motion. If you're squatting as fast as possible and are hitting full ROM for every single one, you're probably not squatting fast enough. I also really like your insight about people getting notoriety as being a form of compensation; that's very applicable to the basketball audience I'm coaching now. Thank YOU for always reading the stuff and giving feedback. I'd be curious to see a two-week sample of programming from you as well!

People are probably just getting better at CF overall, which inevitably moves the bar.
I‚Äôve drifted away from trying to ‚Äúget better‚Äù at CF vs using it as a tool to enhance life, hobbies, and health. Notwithstanding, I still love the daily challenge of it!
