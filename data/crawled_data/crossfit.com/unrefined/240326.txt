Scaling:

This benchmark workout was 
first posted
 on CrossFit.com on Sept. 19, 2003. Diane is intended to be a short, intense effort. Similar to yesterday’s Fran, many athletes have completed this workout in blazing-fast times, but don’t let that deter you from attempting the prescribed version. The load of the barbell should allow you to perform at least 7 unbroken deadlifts every time you pick it up. Reduce the load to achieve this stimulus and, above all, maintain the integrity of the lift. The handstand push-up option you choose should allow you to complete at least 5 reps every time you kick up. Reduce the difficulty of the movement by performing pike push-ups or dumbbell shoulder presses. If you scale the handstand push-up, your variation should not allow you to complete the reps unbroken (if you do, the movement is too easy).


Intermediate option:

21-15-9 reps for time of:

Deadlifts


Pike push-ups


♀ 125 lb


♂ 185 lb


Beginner option:

21-15-9 reps for time of:

Deadlifts


Dumbbell shoulder presses


♀ 75 lb and 15 lb


♂ 115 lb and 20 lb

21-15-9
DeadLift 185lbs
BarDips 
Was really tired and lack of sleep hangover from work week. Did some quick mid Squats before then just jumped into workout. Dips were limiting, DeadLift got stronger but grip waned. Hit muscle failure on dips, and tested grip endurance.

Intermediate Option
2:40
I 100% should have done the RX’d weight, but tweaked my wrist a few days ago and the idea of handstand push-ups on a bum wrist seemed sketchy. So went with intermediate option as pike push-ups seemed safer and flew through it. Heart is for sure pounding though!

Rx weight (225), scaled HSPU to piked push-ups (feet on 30" box)
6:38 (re-establishing as PR)
Compare to 230306: same scale, 7:41
HSPU still aren't happening again yet, but there was no elbow pain with the piked push-ups this time so I may be trending in the right direction.  Broke once each on 21 and 15 sets for both movements - just too much time spent breathing in between movements.

M/49/6'2"/185#
Scaled to 185# DL's and 35# DxKB strict press/push press combo = 1 rep...
7:48
The sp/pp combo was probably a little to heavy it really slowed things down only able to get ~ 3 reps at a time on the round of 15 and 9 newho a really good dose

Rxd. At the Y. 
10:36. 
2023 - 8:38 (scaled HSPU ROM with yoga block)
Wanted to give full ROM on the HSPUs. Was a little shallow on a few reps (I’m looking at your round of 15) but overall happy I was able to complete this many. All strict.

Huh, was thinking today how my lack of recent HSPU training equates to weaker wrists during Fran, and here we are.

Globo wod:  Dumbbell sub for deadlifts are 55/80lbs dumbbells. If you are using 50lbs dumbbells men double reps, women add 3 per set.  If your globo doesn't allow HSPU or doesn't have a place for them sub dumbbell strict presses at 60% bodyweight total weight for the dumbbells combined.
